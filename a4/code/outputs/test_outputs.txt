You know what I do is write for the kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for a kids, you read in the United States.
And I always tell people I don't want to seem like a scientist.
I can <unk> like farmer, or with <unk> and no one has chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany generally is something that fell into a place.
You just have to turn the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the middle school in the middle school, in the middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare class.
When I went to bleed every week in the bathroom of the boys, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by letting me go into the bathroom of the teachers.
I was doing it in secret.
For three years.
And I had to go from the city.
I had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the <unk> I felt the need to start working in organizations that fight against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, half the night I got a phone call from that <unk> Mrs. <unk> who said, "I need to see you.
I'm glad we never got to know us.
You could put it into Ohio, and please bring it to that man that I know you've found.
And I have to tell you that I have <unk> cancer, and I'd like you to stick with this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
And we went to see, we got <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found it a place, the <unk> and the <unk> and the take care of her family, because it was necessary, for it.
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> became a <unk> box, and it was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had been closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I talked about was made in the present itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save her.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs to be true and beauty, and I'm very happy today talking about this.
It also needs to -- needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and that everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can quickly, I was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
The <unk> to me about the water around the water almost 60 meters. And I couldn't even think that it was a <unk> of snow on another <unk> year after year.
<unk> are born when they get out of glaciers or they break up the barriers of ice.
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some of them refuse to give up and hold up to the end, whereas others can't afford it, and they would lie in a <unk> passion <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated separated and themselves, as we look at us sometimes as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
As a <unk> I'm breathing on a <unk> I'm breathing on his atmosphere.
As a iceberg melts that it releases freshwater rich in minerals that feeds many forms of life.
I come up to photograph these <unk> as if it was about the portraits.
It's not the death when they <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of its way through the cycle of life.
Part of the <unk> <unk> that photograph is very <unk> it has a couple thousand years old.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last pictures I would like to show you are from a iceberg from <unk> Greenland.
It's unlikely to actually get a little bit of <unk>
Here it is.
You can see the left a little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your line of <unk>
You can see here, it starts to <unk> the boat has moved to the other side and the man is there.
This is an Greenland, <unk> iceberg <unk>
You drop out of water about 120 feet or 40 feet.
This video is in real time.
And so the iceberg shows a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every single child, a baby. Okay.
So, two couples each with a baby.
I don't want you to get too close to the details of conception, because if you stop thinking about conception.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in a case, the <unk> and the sperm is joined the X chromosome.
And in the other case, the X chromosome from sperm is joined the X chromosome.
Both <unk> and it starts life.
We'll be able to talk about them later.
In my activity that I would see two roles.
In one of my <unk> I work with the story of anatomy.
I'm a <unk> training and what I study in this case is the way that people <unk> the anatomy -- the human bodies -- and <unk> how they have considered the body fluids -- the idea of <unk> what have you thought about the body.
The other role that performance in my work is an activist, as a <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> for people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've been working with people whose physical features challenge social norms.
I've been working working, for example, two people within a same body.
I've been working with people with <unk> people much lower than average.
And I've been working with many cases of people with human <unk> individuals whose physics typology don't fit in the male and female <unk>
In general, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> lots of forms.
I'm going to give you some examples of ways of having a sex that doesn't lie in male or female forms.
For example, there is the case of the individual with <unk> <unk> <unk> whose <unk> gene of the chromosome and says to the <unk> that we all have in the <unk> life that we all have in life.
And then, in life we <unk> the testicles produce testosterone.
But because this individual lacks testosterone, your body doesn't react to itself.
It's the <unk> syndrome.
So, there's high testosterone levels.
As a consequence, the body develops in a typically <unk> course.
When you shake the baby a little bit of a little girl.
It's a little girl. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing and developing breast but you don't have the time long, when someone realizes something is going on.
After doing tests you realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has testicles and a chromosome.
The important thing to understand is that you can think of a man, but it's actually not like that.
Women, as the men, we have in the body something called <unk> <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the hormone <unk>
Most women like me -- I consider a <unk> woman who don't know his <unk> structure, I think it will be a typical woman most women like me are sensitive to the <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a result, somebody like me has the most exposed brain to <unk> than the woman who was born with testicles that have the Yentl syndrome <unk>
That's why sex is complicated -- it's not that the <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some form they can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago I got a call from a 19-year-old was born and raised as a <unk> had girlfriend, and sexual relationships, he had a life like a boy and I had just found out that he had <unk> and <unk>
He had an extreme way of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
It had the 20th chromosomes and the uterus -- the <unk> glands, they were so active that, in essence, created a male hormone environment.
As a result, his genitals were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone component typically the male component of the male.
He was born with <unk> no one <unk> anything.
And it was at age 19, when he started to have medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when doctors discovered that, in fact, was a woman in it.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with 20th chromosomes develop what's known as <unk> is to say, <unk> tissue <unk> wrapped up in <unk> tissue.
We don't know what that happens.
So, there's a lot of sex.
The reason that children with these kinds of bodies -- so we are <unk> twins or <unk> or <unk> <unk> to surgery is not to be able to have a better physical health for a better physical health.
In many cases people are perfectly healthy.
The reason why it was <unk> several surgeries is that they are a threat to our social categories.
The system is usually based on the idea that a particular anatomy is bringing together a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is to have <unk> identity.
A terribly simplistic.
And when you present it a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of the <unk> very romantic.
Imagine the amazing thing that is to have children that are born as two people within one body.
The most high place is last year with the South African <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk>
Many journalists called to ask, "What do you test are going to do to determine whether <unk> <unk> is man or <unk>
And I had to explain to you the reporters that don't have such a test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't trace a curved line between men and women and women and <unk> and women and <unk> and we are who we put that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we go through the science, the more we have to admit that these categories -- that we thought was that these categories -- stable that are <unk> directly with <unk> categories -- they are much more <unk> than they <unk>
And not just in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that turns out much more complicated than the terminology of <unk>
So as we see, we go into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What did you find?
And as we put in the science of science we get more and more in a uncomfortable area where we have to recognize that the infinite categories that <unk> probably are too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture in the United States of today, are the struggles at the beginning and the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very important discussions today in the day, not in public, but within the <unk> about when someone is considered dead.
Our ancestors never had to take care of this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of he would put a pen in front of his nose in front of the nose and he was still moving still.
If I stopped moving through it.
But we can, for example, to extract vital organs from a body and put them in another body.
And as a result, we have to deal with a dilemma of how death actually is. And this puts us in a hard situation, where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And maybe think that this explosion of categories could be played by someone like me.
In politics I'm a liberal, <unk> people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that he gets nervous.
I mean that these categories are much more fragile than we thought about <unk>
It's going to happen from the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first, I have to admit that I'm a fervent fan of Parents <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and bold and so radical in what they did, which I find every moment watching that musical <unk> <unk> and not by music, which is totally <unk>
This is what happened in <unk> with parents <unk>
Parents <unk> the first activists in the anatomy and explain why.
What they <unk> was a <unk> concept and <unk> with another which was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And as you all remember what our parents are, the <unk> was the idea of <unk> <unk> was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs in the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of birth to birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that the political power was being used by the right of blood passed from the grandfather to the father and then the son, etc.
Parents <unk> rejected that idea and replaced it for a new <unk> concept and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They <unk> the game field and decided that anatomy that mattered was the anatomy of common anatomy in common and not <unk> <unk>
And they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and the same time <unk> science.
And it stays very clear, if you look at the story of Parents -- that many were very interested in science and the idea of a world <unk>
They were <unk> from the <unk> explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of <unk> being passed by going from a kind of a <unk> idea of birth to birth.
They were moving towards a <unk> concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of <unk> talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And as a result, they were passing the idea of coincidence <unk>
And by doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the world's rights movement.
They didn't think that way, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened next?
And women <unk>
And then the success of the Civil Rights movement with people from <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of the Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man.
And again, people in color who are going to make a coincidence that we have a difference, and again, <unk>
We see the same with the Movement of the <unk>
The problem is, of course, as we look at <unk> we have to start asking questions why we keep certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish, the same rights as a human.
I don't mean that we should take it to anatomy.
I don't want to say that at the age of five years they would allow them to have sex or get married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me to make sense and that I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why do they keep them and make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two <unk> at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the <unk> exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, Mary, was born three months before time, on June 1, 1980.
So Henry, the opposite.
For the only fact that I was born three months before Mary were attributed to all the rights three months before Henry -- the right to the law of sexual consent, the right to the vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because I have a different biological age, but because he was born later.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, by virtue of being considered a man -- if I haven't told you whether it's <unk> by virtue of being considered man now is <unk> from the compulsory <unk> that Mary has no to worry about.
Mary, for his hand, it doesn't have the same rights to marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all the states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman just in some states.
So still <unk> categories -- that in various aspects are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science moved so much in the field of the anatomy that we have to admit that a democracy based on anatomy could be <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science is <unk>
Where do we go from here?
It seems that what happens in our culture is kind of a <unk> attitude -- we have to draw the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people are stuck in a strange position.
For example, Texas at a certain point he has decided that to marry a man doesn't have to have a chromosome, and that to marry a woman has to have Y chromosome.
Now, in practice, they don't do tests for people.
But this is also very strange, given the story that I told you at the beginning of the <unk> syndrome.
If we look at one of the founders of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his "I love <unk> offers a solution.
It says that we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the contents of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yeah, the idea looks pretty good."
But in practice, how do you do it?
How do people judge the basis of their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that we should be able to focus on this to provide rights to people, because I have to admit that I know some of the <unk> <unk> who probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more intelligent decisions and <unk> about their sexual relationships than people from 40 to know.
So how do you put the subject of <unk> content.
It's very difficult.
And one part of me wonder what would happen if the character of one person could be in the future being measured with an instrument, maybe with an MRI machine.
We want to really get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States will continue this current thinking stream to the issue of democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian in which a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to being <unk> unless you're willing to be killed, unless you're willing to be killed, unless you are willing to be <unk>
We're not in that situation.
And I'm glad to say that we don't have a context as a surgeon who talked about a couple of years ago that I had done to give birth twins and then separate them and then <unk> her name.
But when the phone asked her for the operation -- he was a very glamorous operation -- he told me that in that other country these kids would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
What I said, "Well, has considered the political asylum instead of <unk> <unk>
The U.S. offers huge possibilities for people to be who are not <unk> to change by the sake of the state.
So I think we have to be on the head.
Well, to finish the end of it, I mean I've been talking a lot about <unk>
And I want to think about how democracy, or as I could have been, if we had given more involvement to <unk>
And I want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist, and is that I think there may be different ideas from different <unk> <unk> particularly if there are people thinking about a group.
For years ago, because I've been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in investigating the sexual difference.
And one of the things that I've been interested in is the differences between men and women in terms of thinking and operate in the world.
And what we know about studying studies is that women, on average, -- not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and deal with those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
years ago, when I was at graduate school, one of my <unk> who knew that I was interested in the genomic Feminism -- I considered <unk> <unk> made me a <unk>
<unk> what about female <unk>
And I thought, "It's the stupidest question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to do with getting rid of adopting gender stereotypes -- so there's no female in the <unk>
But the more I've thought about your question, the more I think has something like a female <unk>
I mean, there could be something on average, something different between the female brain and the male that makes us more <unk> to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if I know the parents were very figuring out how to find the way to protect people from the state, it is possible that there are more <unk> to this concept, maybe we had enriched the concept of protection with <unk> support.
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we get democracy beyond the <unk> thinking less in the individual body, in terms of identity, and thinking about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect union and think of what we do about each other.
Thank you.
In the year 2007, I decided we had to reconsider how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where they want to go live and work on, have the ability to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, right now, we're far away from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't count in a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they're worth much more than their building cost.
So we could easily take them into the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you have never thought about new cities.
But it just took out of the apartments.
So imagine that half of those who wanted to live in apartments are already owners, and the other half is still not lack of it.
They could try to increase the ability making <unk> all the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and the areas that surround them have rules to avoid the <unk> and the distractions of the construction.
So it would be very difficult to do all those <unk>
But they could go to a totally new place to build a fully new apartment building and always when the standards of that <unk> we would have the construction instead of putting <unk>
So I proposed that the governments are going to put together new language areas to contain cities and gave them a name: cities under <unk>
I learned that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of Honduras.
Did you know that every year about 75,000 people will crawl from their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> happened by a constitutional constitutional crisis.
In the next election election, <unk> <unk> became <unk> with a platform where we had <unk> reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked <unk> to be his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of evidence with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most essential.
The first point was the importance of the rules, like those rules that say that you can't go and conserve all the current residents of apartments.
We spend a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes so much of technologies like rules for <unk> and usually they are the rules that prevent us from going forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent to <unk> a link to <unk>
He showed it to <unk>
They called me.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, to a conference room.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable cities are, much more valuable than the cost of <unk>
And I used this picture that shows the value of land in a place like New York City, which in some cases, worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion and at some point, when there was a pause, <unk> said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
And the talk described in very simple terms, that a city under <unk> is a place where you start with a <unk> terrain -- which is a <unk> which is <unk> the rules that are going on, and an option for people to choose whether they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> called me and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way that our country will move forward.
And he asked me to be <unk> and I would talk about the four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included a picture like this, which was trying to explain that to make a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Just this airport is over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that is about 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
The whole world <unk>
The public faces were very serious and <unk>
The leader of Congress came up to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you very much for your talk, but maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
I have this in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this <unk> explained that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be a choice of a city that you might go to be in <unk> instead of hundreds of miles away to the North.
And also, new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of the <unk> government would need help from <unk> countries they could benefit from the countries that help them to establish and make the rules of <unk> so that they could all rely on the <unk> effectively <unk>
We went and saw one site.
This picture is there.
It could take for a thousand square miles.
And shortly after, the 19 of January, they voted in Congress to <unk> his Constitution and add a constitutional available to allow you to create these special regions of development.
In a country that just passed through this <unk> crisis, the voting in Congress for this constitutional <unk> was from <unk> to one.
All the parties, all the <unk> in society, <unk>
To <unk> in the <unk> it has to pass twice in Congress.
On February 17, we passed again in another voting on the other way to get to one.
Immediately after the voting on the age of 21, another <unk> <unk> <unk> was to the two places in the world that are most interested in engaging in cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new center of the city that is building in Korea, it's bigger than the Boston in Boston.
Everything you see there was built in four years, after they spent four years getting the <unk>
The other country interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this practical way, this is the point where we are.
They have a website, and they're already thinking about a place for the second city.
They are preparing a legal system that would allow the administrators to share, and they would allow them to operate under an external legal system.
A country has already committed to allowing its Supreme Court to be the last court for this new <unk> system.
There are urban <unk> and the builders of cities that are very interested in the project.
You can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know that they have already solved is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are many companies that wanted to be in the <unk> especially in a place in a free trade, and there's a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change immediately somewhere else.
There are a million a year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave their family behind their family to get a job <unk> sometimes they have to earn the money for just to eat or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes there are even children who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen in some cases, in a decade.
So what do you think about building a new city in <unk>
Or do you build a dozen these, or a hundred of these all over the world?
What do you think about insist that families can choose between various cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends <unk> I was asked to say, "Thank you TED.
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what there is inside, I'm going to make a <unk> and it's that I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find these, and more recently, photograph and publish in my blog and colorful <unk> and different for every time.
But I don't buy anything new.
All my clothes is a second hand of <unk> markets and <unk> shops.
Oh, thank you.
The second hand stores let me reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment, and in my <unk>
I go to meet people <unk> usually my money goes to a good <unk> My aspect is <unk> and buying it into my personal search <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
<unk>
I'm going to like the color of?
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel I've won.
To go back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what I would take for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what does anybody bring up with all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I was suit.
I've brought seven pairs of inner clothes, and nothing else.
So inside a week it's all I've put in my <unk>
I thought it would be able to find everything else that I would like to use after you get here to Palm <unk>
And because I don't know me as the woman who walks for TED in underwear,  that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
Does it sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that, believe it or not, I've learned in this adventure of not using new clothes.
Let's start with Sunday.
This is what I call this <unk>
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You can almost always see a phenomenal for less than 50 dollars.
All the together, including the <unk> took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've used in the week.
<unk> the color is energy.
It's almost impossible to be no bad humor, when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> The integration is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time <unk>
I just know yourself.
If you get away from the right people, you don't just love you, you love you."
<unk> <unk> of the child that you carry in.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems to play the <unk> or I remember their <unk>
I like <unk> and saying, <unk>
<unk> Trust is key.
If you think you're good at something, it's pretty sure you are.
And if you think you don't look good at something, it's probably also true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years that I really understood his meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your interior and outside, you don't look at you that you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse for anybody in this audience.
We need to be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal truth, six words for you: The gold <unk> go with it.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal and unique way of telling the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried it over and over again when people were approaching me this week simply by what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home to Brooklyn, and I'm going to give the whole thing.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that we have to leave certain things.
I don't need to be emotionally <unk> these things, because around the corner, there will always be another <unk> <unk> and brilliant <unk> if there's a little love in my heart and after.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can divide in two parts.
The left side, which is the logical side, and the right side, which is the intuitive.
So if you take a scale to measure the <unk> of every <unk> we could design a blueprint for our brain.
For example, this would be someone who is completely logical.
This would be someone who is totally intuitive.
So where are you <unk> your brain at this scale?
Some of these extremes, but I think for most of the members of this audience, their brain is something like this -- with a great <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that they're mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider to be one of those people, that just like most other quantum physicists <unk> we need a lot of logic to address these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need pretty intuition to make experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put them playing with them, and then we see as a <unk> and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
A intuition that you can have developed with the age of the years is the one that says one thing can be only one place at once.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember looking at a little boy playing on a parking bar.
It was a little boy, and he didn't do it very well, it always <unk>
But I bet the playing bar with that parking bar pointed out a lesson, and is that big things don't allow the <unk> and they stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that can be made out of the world, except you are a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with computer bars playing with these strange particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all sorts of really weird things -- like they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called it a theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point was the physics of a few years ago; you needed of quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But they didn't need to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because I don't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not very much.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But it didn't fit very well to my logic.
Because if it's all made out of small particles and all the small particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, so it shouldn't all follow the principles of quantum <unk>
I don't find the reason why it shouldn't be.
And so I would feel so much better if I could somehow prove that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see has been in a overlap of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the metal piece I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And I'm going to zoom in a little bit. You find right in the center.
And then here we make a good approach, the little metal <unk>
What we see is a little bit of metal metal -- <unk> and <unk> <unk> on a platform.
And then I did this almost like a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a clean chip, and I started working all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this little hole in a way that you can find under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum factors, but for it it needs a little help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how awkward, it is to be on an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm on an elevator alone, I do all sorts of weird things, but then when other people go up, I just leave you out of doing those things, because I don't want to get them to <unk> or, actually, they <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The <unk> of inanimate objects are not just people -- it's also the light that <unk> and the wind that goes on the side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little piece of metal to be <unk> according to quantum mechanics, we would have to <unk> all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
<unk> the lights, then <unk> a <unk> and pulled out all the air, and then we would bring it to a temperature of less than a degree on absolute zero.
Now, when you're just going to be in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free to act like it.
So we measure their motions.
We found that it moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, I was vibrating. And the way it <unk> was like a breath in this way -- like a <unk> which is expands and <unk>
And by giving it a soft, <unk> we could make it <unk> and not <unk> at the same time -- something that just happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that something <unk> and not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, every trillion atoms that make that piece of metal are still still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's just at certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they are <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, what it means that the whole piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Really.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years, because, look at this, the difference on scale between one single atom and that piece of metal is more or less the same as the difference between that piece of metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that metal piece can be in two different places, why don't you as well?
I mean, it's my part of the logic that I'm talking about.
So imagine if you were in several places at the same time, how would that be that?
How do your consciousness acting if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we got it, and we turned the lights down and we looked inside the box, we saw that the metal was still there in one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, seemingly all objects on the elevator are actually very quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about the quantum mechanics that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
That's more than that, it's more profound.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define who you are, and that's the profound queerness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And then 18 months ago, I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something about museums and art to my head that is here and that allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 months to me.
Lots of negotiations and stories, they were going to be done with very interesting museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There are a lot of stories about why we did.
I think my own story is just explaining to this slide and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> of a great education -- I didn't get back, but I didn't have access to many of these museums and artwork.
So when I started traveling and go to museums, I began to learn a lot.
And working on Google, I try to make reality more accessible to making it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team -- a great team of people, and we started doing it.
You'd better show the demo, to then tell you a couple of interesting things that we have done from their launch.
So, <unk> we're going to <unk>
Look around all of the museums there.
There is the gallery gallery at MoMA, the <unk> the <unk> Van <unk>
I actually go into one of my favorite ones, the <unk> the art museum in New York.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we're inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that really doesn't matter.
You move around and get <unk>
They want to navigate by the <unk>
We open the flat, and with one click, we jumped inside.
They're inside, that you want to go at the end of the hall,
Let's go forward. That will be <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign.
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
Look, this is one of the images.
Here is all the information from <unk>
For those of you who are truly interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click out here right now.
And this is one of the images we've captured in what we call <unk> technology.
So this image, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 billion universes.
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get 10,000 million <unk>
So I'll show you what you really get with 10,000 billion pixel up.
You can zoom in around a very simple way.
You see things that are going on.
I love this guy, his expression has no price.
But if you really want to want to look at it.
So I started to play, and I found something that was going on there.
And I said, "A moment, this seems <unk>
I came up and discovered that the kids were actually playing something.
And it was a little bit, I talked to some people in the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which consists of hitting a <unk> with a Tuesday <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get deeper and you see that you can actually get into the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to pull the picture, so you'll see what there is.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is for coming, a second.
So now we're going to quickly jump to jump again at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, <unk>
The example I showed was to find some details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see what van Gogh actually created this <unk>
It increases and actually <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk>
Let me show you another one of my favorite functions.
There's a lot more things here, but I don't have time to <unk>
This is the really cool part: It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely everyone, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you the same.
You can online to create your own museum, create your own collection from all these images.
It's very simple, you go on -- I've created this function that I call "The <unk> <unk> -- we just made a zooming in it.
This is <unk> at the National Gallery in London.
You can write things up, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel at the contemplating of these <unk> works.
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all amazing things don't really come from Google.
No, in my opinion, even from museums.
Maybe I should not say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that's been my experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium will do justice to its work of art and which is represented properly online.
And the big question that you do today is: "You did this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
You think it's a <unk> a pixel <unk>
In our lab we call it sensitive design.
Let me tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm about Italian origin -- all the children in Italy grew up with this picture on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that it has happened very interesting in school racing in the last two decades.
Now some time ago, if you wanted to win a year of Formula 1, take a budget and put it into a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you won my career.
This is what it is that, in engineering, you know, <unk> system for real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Now, what's interesting is that the control systems in real time are starting to enter our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're becoming computers in the open.
And as <unk> they're starting to respond differently and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As some note -- I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the crust of the planet, but they represent 50 percent of the population of the planet.
75 percent of the <unk> consumption and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with cities, it would be big.
Beyond cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibition of <unk> <unk> in MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, they start to <unk>
It's kind of like almost all of the existing atoms to come back sensors and <unk>
And that's completely changing the interaction that we humans have with the outside environment.
It is almost like the old dream of Michelangelo <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> said that at the end it took the <unk> and they threw the hammer down to the Moses -- you can still see a little dent in a <unk> and he said he said, <unk> sine <unk> and so what don't you <unk>
Well, today, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just <unk> <unk> in the idea of taking the environment and push something.
Let's start with the detection of it.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects of our lab.
This was four and a half years in Italy.
It was a very lucky summer, in 2006.
It was the year when Italy won the World Cup in the World.
Maybe some of the remember, they were playing Italy and France, and at the end, <unk> gave the <unk>
And anyway, at the end I won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by looking at activity happens in the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the river <unk>
It's the morning, before the game.
The time line is at the top.
In the late afternoon, there are people here and there are <unk>
It starts the <unk> silence.
<unk> from France.
You know, people make a quick call and go into the bathroom.
Second time. End of time.
First time <unk> a second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
They win Italy, yeah!
That night everyone went to <unk>
There you see the big summit.
The next day everyone went to the center of the winner and the first minister of the United Minister then.
And then the whole world <unk>
You see the picture of the place called <unk> <unk> where, since the age of <unk> people are going to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the city pulse in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do just a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> it's not about people, but of things we use and consume.
Today, we know all about the front of our objects.
This is a map that shows all of the chips that make up a Mac, how it would be.
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project, we developed a little bit of little tags to track the trash in its shift by the system.
We started with some volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little bit more than a year ago, to tag what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that would be <unk>
Then we put a little chip, one tag on the garbage and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
After a week.
With this information we realized that there are lots of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same thing with a lot less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
They're going on complicated things, and there's a lot of need.
But the other thing that we think is that if we look at every day that the cup that we never <unk> is still somewhere on the planet.
If the plastic bottle we <unk> one day is still there.
So if we show that to people, then we can promote some change of behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us much more about detection and lots of other great things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked about at the beginning, which is <unk> on the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in <unk>
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city who came and told us that Spain and the South Europe has a beautiful tradition of water in public space in architecture.
And the question was, how can technology, new technology, to join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a shop is, imagine you have a <unk> <unk> valves which are open and <unk>
It was created as a curtain of water, with water pixels with water.
If you go to the pixels you can write on them, show patterns, images texts.
And when we zoom in, the curtain is opening up for us to happen, as you see in the image.
And we presented this to the Mayor <unk>
He liked it very much.
and <unk> a commission to design the entrance to the entrance to the <unk>
We call it a <unk>
The whole building is made of water.
There is no windows or windows, but when you come up and open up so you can happen.
The roof is also covered in water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> it goes down the roof.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears, like in this case.
And those days, there will always be somebody in the winter, when the roof, someone who was there and said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when it goes down almost all the architecture goes away.
Here it is working.
You see the people <unk> by what happens inside.
And here I am kind of trying to do not <unk> the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more fun.
All the children of <unk> came to the building, because the way to interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that was opening up to leave you -- but a building that was following <unk> and water holes and you had to jump out of not <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was really interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about use people to give our designs.
But then the reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to interact that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pixels the pixels of water, and of projections about them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start flying.
Imagine that you could have little helicopters in the air, and that each one had a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud moving in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, as we saw before, which is moving with other in sync.
We could form this cloud,
So a kind of flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or normal, but in three dimensions, what changes is the light, not the position of the pixel position.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen appears to appear on different scales and sizes, in different kinds of resolution.
And that then all that could be a cloud of pixels in 3D where you can get closer and forth and see from very different <unk>
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like before.
When the light turns out, it looks like this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them controlled by a person.
We can have each pixel with an input that comes from people, the movement of the people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> of the world's best dancers of childhood today, the star of New York City and <unk> <unk> to capture its movement in 3D and use them as input for <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> in different <unk>
It's so <unk> in real time as it capture.
It can make all of the movement.
You can go across the way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with the color and the movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible input for <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, can you imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our environment as an oyster nursery like a <unk> farm like <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make everybody <unk> a little bit for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we went from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything as knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign is <unk> we can move from the digital world <unk> of the <unk> to the physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today: think of climate change or the CO2 emissions, how do we move from the digital world to the physical world.
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, together differently.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a cloud cloud.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are pixel up.
It's a physical structure in London, but covered from pixel up.
You can move around the inside, have different experiences.
You can see from the bottom for sharing the main moments of the 2012 Olympics of 2012 and even more, and it can be used as a form of connection with the community.
So it's both a physical cloud of the sky as something you can go up, like a new top of London.
You can go into there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is that it will be a new experience for anybody to go to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than are they?
Suppose I told you that, with just a lot of changes in your genes, they could improve the <unk> for more accurate, and faster.
Or maybe they would like to be in better ways, to get more <unk>
Would you like to be more attractive and secure about ourselves?
How about living with good health?
Or maybe they're from those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What else would you tell them?
What do you want, if you could choose something?
<unk> from the Audience: <unk> <unk>
How many people are going to help creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> probably had the amount of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many would you choose the memory?
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Oh, most of them. That makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have something of this the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe it is possible?
Evolution has been a theme issue here at the TED Conference.
The big <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> that in the church Church -- <unk> wrote an essay called "Nothing in biology, makes sense of light from <unk>
But if you effectively accept biological evolution consider this: it's just the past, or the future?
Is it about others or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch in one end, is, of course, the most interest in the world.
<unk> of a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
There has been maybe 20 or 25 different species of <unk>
Some of you have gone and <unk>
We've been here a few years old.
It might seem that we are very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in its most basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can harness and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the human insulin protein that is used to treat the <unk>
This is not like human insulin but it's the same protein, chemically <unk> from the <unk>
And by talking about bacteria -- they realize that we all carry on the other family, bacteria that we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- when Antonio <unk> do the <unk> think about the <unk>
The gut is a beautifully inflated environment for those bacteria.
It is warm hot zone, it's very <unk>
And we're going to provide all the nutrients that they can want with no effort on their own.
It really is like a quick pathway for bacteria with the occasional disruption of some <unk> rush to the way around.
But by others, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria so that they are essential for our life.
They help digest nutrients and protect us from certain diseases.
But what do we ask the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or meant to become something different, something perhaps better <unk>
In this vast <unk> symphony of the universe, the life on Earth is as a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, like one and unique <unk> and human life, a little note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk, so I hope you've got this one.
When I first went to college I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution and I realized something fundamental in most of the existence of life, in the organisms, each cell is just <unk> and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two cells.
But when organisms appear to happen, things start to change.
He goes into the sexual reproduction.
And something very important, with the emergence of sexual reproduction that goes through the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, one might say that the <unk> of your body death comes into evolution at the same moment of sexual reproduction.
I have to tell you that when I was a college student, I was like, well, <unk> <unk> death for <unk> it seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year he was happening, every time I had more <unk>
I was to understand the feelings of George <unk> who still <unk> in Las Vegas in their 90s.
And one night someone hits their door to a hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of him he finds a slight slight slight <unk> clothes.
And he looks at it, and he says, <unk> for a <unk> of <unk>
And I said, George, <unk> I choose the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working for a different target to the goal of <unk> not necessarily just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted us to get healthy us.
I wanted to restore health in disease.
I wanted us to live more and a healthier way.
Evolution is to move the genome to the next <unk> adapted and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are kind of like <unk> designed to send the genetic burden to the next level, and then let us fall into the sea.
I think all of all, the feeling that expressed Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality through my work.
I want to make it <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily favors longevity.
It doesn't necessarily favors the greatest or stronger or faster or faster and even the most smart.
Evolution favors the best adapted to their environment.
That's the only proof of survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean -- bacteria <unk> that they can survive the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if there were fish there, <unk> fish in a vacuum, yet they've managed to make that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we look back to think about the place of humans in evolution and in particular, if we look forward to the <unk> phase -- I would say there are many possibilities.
The first one is that we don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying discussion of reasoning would be that through medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and separated from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment to be adapted to us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, we <unk> and we were so excited that it's no longer possible to have the isolation necessary for evolution.
A second possibility is that we produce an evolution of the traditional type, natural type, dictated by the forces of nature.
And the argument here is, that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And as soon as the <unk> as a sort of <unk> planets are going to exist there and the environmental changes that can produce evolution in a natural way.
But there is a third possibility, a bit more possibility, and <unk>
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and selected for us as individuals in the decisions that we would have to do.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
We first consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more male than women.
It's not necessarily a good thing for society, but it's what it takes on the individual and family level.
Think of it as well as possible to be able to choose not only the sex of their <unk> but in their own body to make the genetic adjustments to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's disease or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate <unk>
You wouldn't want to do those changes in your <unk>
If we look at the future that kind of changes is going to be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990, and she sued 13 years.
<unk> million dollars.
The next year of being finished, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the three billion base pairs in the human genome to a cost close to about 20,000 and one week.
Not so much to make the human genome actually make the human genome for <unk> and it will be increasingly at the grasp of all.
Those changes.
The same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect us from themselves, but they are going to be immunity.
You know, or there's no experimental essay in the course of the flu vaccine -- in a <unk> of <unk>
Can you imagine something nice that comes out of the <unk>
That is reality today and the future is going to be increasingly possible.
Imagine just two little <unk>
They can change the cells in their bodies, but if they could change the cells from their <unk>
And if they could change the sperm and the <unk> or changing the <unk> <unk> and giving their children a better chance of a more healthy life to remove the diabetes, remove the <unk> to reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want children more <unk>
And then, that same analytical technology -- that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases is going to allow us to also adopt <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why don't you have the <unk> of a Ken <unk> especially if you could deal with the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why don't you have a <unk> muscle that allows us to run faster and more <unk>
Why not live longer?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in conditions to pass this into the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to become the evolution of before the <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally could take 100,000 years and we can take it to 1,000 years and maybe happened within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are they going to have to have them.
We're going to use these choices to make a better more successful, more successful society.
Or, we're going to selectively choose different attributes that we want for some of us, but not for everybody else?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more robust or more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the deepest of all, we're going to be able to develop wisdom and <unk> the wisdom required to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or for worse, and before what I could tell you, these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a great explosion when you're at 900 feet tall.
Imagine an airplane full of smoke.
Imagine an engine doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> It sounds frightening.
Well, I had a unique seat that day, I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one who could talk to the flight <unk>
So immediately I looked at it, and they said, "No problem. You probably slam some <unk>
And the pilot had already taken off the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot <unk> the plane with the Hudson River.
Mostly that's not the road.
So the motors.
Imagine being on an airplane and without <unk>
And then he said three words.
The three words I have heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk more with the flight assistant.
I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was terror. Life is <unk>
I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before they die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to get and I did all the fences that I wanted to <unk> all the experiences I've wanted to have and never <unk>
While I was thinking about that, and I came up with a sentence, which is, <unk> wine <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open.
I don't want to do anything in life.
And that urgency, that way, has really changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is as I <unk> the bridge George Washington, which was not a lot -- I thought about, Whoa! I really feel a big <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my errors I've been trying to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity I also took place to my ego.
And I'm sorry for the time that we would focus on things that didn't care about people who matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, as a result, I decided to eliminate the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels <unk>
I am no longer trying to have <unk> <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is how your mental clock is going <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to be <unk> in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I grew up, I had the feeling of, Whoa! I die not fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for that all of our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to myself, I love my life.
And that sadness will become a single thought, which is, I just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my children grow.
A month later, I was in a performance performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent -- <unk> --  And I scream, <unk> like a small one.
And for me, that was the whole reason for being the world.
At that point I realized that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
He gave me a miracle, not to die that day.
And he gave me another gift, which was the possibility to look at the future and come back and live in another way.
You who are flying today, the challenge that you can imagine that the same thing happens on your plane -- and please be not so -- but imagine, and how do you get it?
What is that what <unk> that they still expect to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How do you change your relationships and negative energy.
And most importantly, they are the best parents who are <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with many different projects.
But the most cool thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the 1980s.
One day he came home after running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
<unk> has total <unk>
You can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design and animation company, so obviously, graffiti is something that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
And so we decided that we were going to <unk> <unk> <unk> and his cause.
So I went and met her brother and father and I said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "Just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second, is not that you saw Stephen <unk> you see Stephen <unk> is not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you're someone important and have a good insurance you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do they communicate then?"
Did anybody see the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate that way -- they go <unk> with your finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How can it be?"
So I presented to the only desire to deliver a check and instead he signed a check that didn't have the least idea of how it was going to <unk>
I love her with his brother and his father there at that very precise moment, all right, so this is the <unk> Tony going to talk, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make his art again.
Because it's ridiculous that somebody who has so much on your inner can't <unk>
So I talked about a conference a couple of months later.
And I met these guys called <unk> Research <unk> which has a technology that allows you to project a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer that you draw on that and you record the negative space.
So they go around making art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, are part of a life cycle.
They start with sex organs, then with the bad words, after the attacks to Bush and in the end, people start doing art.
But there was always a life cycle in your <unk>
And so he started the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and a lot of organization and a lot of moving things around we had a couple of things.
One, you touch the gates of the insurance companies and get a machine that you could make a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's about the <unk> I call it <unk> because when you talk to the guy -- you get an email from him, and you say, "Don't <unk> This guy is <unk>
The other thing we did was to bring seven programmers all over the world <unk> from every single corner of the <unk> to our house.
My wife, and I moved to the garage behind and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> took control of the house.
Many of our friends thought we were doing something completely stupid and that when they were born, they would have taken away from the walls and in their place there would be <unk>
But for two weeks, we were going to go to the <unk> tour, my son was part of my dog as well, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
They are a couple of <unk> sun, we buy on the <unk> shipping ride of <unk> Beach, some copper wire and <unk> <unk> and Radio <unk>
We take a camera <unk> the <unk> we put it into an LED light, and now there's a device that is free -- and now there's a device that is free -- we published the code <unk> the software is low for free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company that says, "No."
There is no hospital to say "No."
Any person with paralysis today has access to drawing and communicate using only their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks, we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person, and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after more than a year of planning, two weeks of proving intense sessions all night, Tony came back to drawing for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of its life, and it's looking through the support system.
We ran the bed for me to see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the parking lot outside the hospital.
And he turned to drawing for the first time in front of his family and friends -- you can imagine what the feeling was in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to disrupt in the parking lot, so we felt like we were <unk> graffiti as well.
At the end of this he sent us an email and this was what he said, "This was the first time I was seven years old.
I felt like I had been under the water and someone finally came to <unk> and get me out there so that I could make it happen.
It's not <unk>
In a way, that's our scream.
That's what keeps us in motion, <unk>
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a cool device, but it's the equivalent of a hormone <unk>
Somebody with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we are trying to figure out how to go out and make it faster and robust.
Since then we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've gained many prizes.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are doing money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were like, "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us and then in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the top 50 inventions of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about this -- and this is what ends of closing the <unk> is that in April of this year in the <unk> of Los Angeles in the middle of Los Angeles is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in the <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all of them will be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show, which is pretty impressive.
So, basically this is my idea: if you see something that is not possible, do it possible.
Nothing in this room was possible -- the stage, the computer, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at a moment.
Do it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with <unk> recognition technology -- I just recognized something, and I was excited to have wonderful people to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want you to all do every day when we find ourselves with something that we feel like you have to do. If you're not now, you know, if I'm not me, you are who?
Thank you, guys.
I've spent the last few years <unk> in situations generally very difficult and at the same time a dangerous dangerous time.
I went to the tough <unk>
I worked in a silver <unk> mine.
<unk> in areas of <unk> difficult and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days a little bit fun in the beginning, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career I've been involved in situations in situations like horrible things with the only goal to treat.
So when I learned that I would come here to do a TEDTalk about the world of the brands and the <unk> I wanted to do something a little bit differently.
So some of you may have heard of it, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took an <unk> <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I volunteered to sell the rights of my TEDTalk on 2011.
What I had was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it comes to and according to content could happen in the face, especially if I put it in ridiculous to you or your company to do it.
But I said this, it's a very good <unk>
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked him a year ago I was unable to do it with certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we looked at the world of marketing, for advertising.
And as I said earlier, I've been in terrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could be done to me for something so difficult or so dangerous as to go into the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to do a film that tries to do the <unk> of products, and the marketing and the advertising, and that all the film was <unk> with <unk> and marketing and advertising.
The film is going to call "The largest film ever <unk>
What happens in "The largest <unk> film is that everything from up at the bottom of the end, it has images of brand, all the time; from the <unk> that appears before the title before the title, <unk>
Now this brand <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all this idea. <unk> <unk> is <unk> It's what? <unk> It's <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> Just <unk> it was more for <unk>
He was <unk> for forever."
But we're not just going to have the sponsors of X brand in the title but we're going to make sure that we would use all the categories that we could in the film.
Maybe you get a shoe -- and it becomes the more cool shoe you've got to be.
The most great car you've ever driven in "The largest ever <unk> the best drink you've ever had <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then in addition to showing the brands as part of the life, make them <unk> the <unk> <unk> to make the <unk> MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the film was full transparency.
You're going to see the whole process in this film.
That's the whole idea, all the shot shot at beginning to end.
And I would love to make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because the first time I hear that is the maximum respect for the audience.
<unk> But I don't know how <unk> it's going to be the people to that.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> <unk> David <unk> How much money does it need to do this?
MS: A million and a half thousand -- very <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be hard the meeting with them, but it's certainly worth to convince a couple of big markings on it.
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that the movie comes out, we looked at it as a bunch of idiots <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the response?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be "No."
MS: But it will be hard to <unk> in the film or to be I?
JK:
MS: <unk> means you're not very optimistic.
So I <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at people that you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places to go, <unk> <unk> <unk>
MS: I thought we <unk> <unk> meant we have a conversation outside the microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And it was, one by one, all of these companies suddenly disappeared.
No one wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was shocked.
They didn't want to know about this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought the concept of advertising, was to introduce the product to as many people as possible, to make so many people see it as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media and the stage of the separate media, is not the idea to tell that new vehicle worthy of attention that will lead the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had a <unk> error and that mistake was this.
Actually, no, there was such a mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been fine.
But the problem was what this image represents image.
See, when you look for images of <unk> on Google <unk>   This is one of the first images that were introduced.
I like your way of <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> of simulation or <unk> easily detected or easily detected that that be characterized by visibility or access of information, especially in <unk> practices.
You see, we hear a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> the president -- the <unk> even CEOs the <unk>
But all of a sudden when it comes to it to make it really it changes suddenly.
But why? Well, the transparency day <unk>  like that weird bear is still <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this rare rural path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
They would have an entire bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's pretty risky.
When I started talking to companies and tell you that we wanted to tell this story and said, "No, we want you to <unk> <unk> history.
We want you to give you a story, but you want to be <unk>
See, when I was a kid, and my father would lie to me in some lie -- and there is him looking at him as he used to say, "Son, there are three sides in history.
There's your story, it's my story, and there is <unk> history.
As you can see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, a agency wanting to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized I would have to go through my mind, I would have to take the mediate and go to the business I was with all my team.
So what I started to see from a sudden -- and I started to give me <unk> is that when you start talking to companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big, enormous, giants and others who make small, independent movies, like mine.
And my friends who make films of Hollywood movies say that the reason their movies have so much successful is because of the brands that they have.
And then my friends who make films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the film is called "The largest film ever <unk>
How are we going to look specifically at <unk> in the movie?
Every time I get out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can say "Are you good cool for this <unk>
You're ready? You see a little nervous.
I want to help you to love you.
Maybe you should get a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there will offer one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> as <unk> of <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much to be a man like to make a solid, <unk> <unk>
That's the big look.
Now I can answer your questions and give them a look at <unk>
Karen Frank: Are we a little brand.
<unk> the kind of smaller movies that we <unk> are more good, a <unk> brand.
So we don't have the budget that they have other brands.
So do things like this, you know, you know, remind people is the reason why this interests us.
MS: What words would use to describe <unk>
<unk> is in white.
<unk> That's a great question.
Volunteer: patterns.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something you put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something like <unk>
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus <unk> the smell and the <unk>
It keeps you cool.
How do we keep you cool more time? You get better <unk> more <unk>
Things like those <unk> <unk>
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about a common kind of type.
I need to talk to the man from the street, to people like me, to the ordinary <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like the good clothes.
Woman: revive the '80s, <unk> <unk> unless it's <unk>
MS: All right, what is the brand <unk>
<unk> Something unique. <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like the dark colors, many gray colors and things like that.
Usually I'm wearing your <unk> or like sunglasses, and the <unk>
Woman: If Dan was a brand a brand could be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: In part of the <unk> partly <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I am the guy in the pets.
They bring toys toys to pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx because he <unk> the <unk>
Man 5: Wait for failure.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm a brand <unk>
<unk> I'm a <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be a brand brand Tom, but I often <unk> at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that kind of brand.
If they could do it for them, they could surely do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the photos, right?
MS: Yeah. The first picture is a familiar photograph.
A: Tell me a little bit about how it relates to your thoughts and feelings your way to be.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: Tell me about that world.
MS: That world? I think that your world is the world that we are looking at, your friends, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things come around and start in a place and in my case, and they start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What is the next one you want to talk about.
MS: The next is "This was the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who I want to be me.
I like different things.
I like <unk> I like the weird stuff.
A: Tell me about the <unk> for what is that?
What's the <unk> What phase of you are right now?
Why is it important <unk> What is the <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
Just more than you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
You don't have to have fear. What kind of mountain are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you.) No, thank you.
A: Thank you for your patience, <unk> Great <unk> A: Yeah.
MS: Yes, I don't know what is going to come out of this.
There was a lot of crazy about this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing that I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but <unk> in your personality of <unk> marks <unk> <unk> is a <unk> brand.
They were <unk> very well.
And I think there's almost a paradox of them.
And I think some businesses will only become one of their strong points or in the other rather than focus on both.
A lot of companies tend to -- and it's nature to avoid the things that are not <unk> avoid the fear, those elements -- and you are actually <unk> and you make something positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are this?
The first here is the <unk> Apple.
And you can see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> marks and <unk> those things that have gone and come in, but a <unk> brand is quite powerful.
MS:
If someone asks you to pursue your brand, your brand, your brand personality and what would be?
You're a <unk> <unk> you're someone who makes blood <unk>
Or are you more <unk>
A little more <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> attributes are like being playful to be cool like <unk> contemporary <unk> or audacious like <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> magical or mystical like <unk>
Or are you rather than attribute <unk>
You're conscious, <unk> like <unk>
You're established, traditional <unk> <unk> <unk> you with <unk>
You are <unk> stable, <unk> <unk> safe, sacred, <unk> or wise -- like the Dalai Lama or <unk>
In the course of this film we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said <unk> they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mostly because they would have no control, they would have no control over the end.
They allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this movie of how you now use MRI and actually use MRI centers to identify the desire centers in the brain so much for movie marketing as a film.
We went to San Paulo where the advertising to the open.
In the entire city for the last five years, there is no <unk> there's no <unk> no <unk>
And we went to school districts that companies are getting on their way in schools with problems in the U.S.
The amazing thing for me is that the projects that I've had the greatest response or the ones I've had more success are those in which I've interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
They went to the <unk> they took their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to deal with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to do to think of people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how has he gone? They had success?
Well, since the movie was sent into the <unk> <unk> Let's take a look.
According to <unk> the film was sent in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This is just a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> no press or TV.
The film is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already begun to win momentum.
And it's not bad, because almost all the agencies that we talked about is giving up their customers not to be part.
I've always believed that if you take risks -- that in those risks there are opportunities.
I think when you get to the people that are pushing them to failure.
I think when you train their employees at the loss of the risk of risk is preparing their entire company for <unk>
I feel that what has to happen to move forward is that we need to encourage people to <unk>
We have to encourage the people who are not afraid of the opportunities that they can afford.
Ultimately, we will move on, I think we need to give it to fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear. <unk> the risk.
From a <unk> at the time, we have to embrace risk.
And ultimately, we have to get the transparency.
Today, a little bit of honesty is going to run a long way.
And I said this, with honesty and transparency, all my talk about: <unk> has been presented by my good friends of <unk> who for <unk> they bought the rights of the name of <unk>
<unk> <unk> huge data in big opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So let's take it in the name of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a remarkable question.
In my pocket I have a check to the name of the TED Revolution, the <unk> Foundation -- a check to my attendance for TED next year.
The idea behind the computer <unk> <unk> is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant of <unk> in <unk>
The gray boxes you see are systems of control in real time.
If we can compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can have a lot of problems with the <unk>
The gray boxes don't use <unk> software are a completely different technology.
But if we were able to put an effective virus of Windows in a laptop used by an engineer in order to set up this <unk> box.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a <unk> Windows.
The <unk> enters the gray box, <unk> <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
Is it easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we find this.
When we started research on <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing I knew is that it's very, very complex in the <unk> part of the <unk> using multiple vulnerabilities <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these boxes, these <unk> control systems.
That struck us the attention, and we started an experiment where we <unk> our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened to this.
So they were very strange.
<unk> themselves like a lab in lab who didn't like our <unk> the wave, but I didn't want to eat.
I had no sense for me.
And then to experiment with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, "This is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
<unk> is looking at actively in the gray box -- if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program is trying to infect it is actually working on that location.
If not, <unk> does nothing.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what the <unk> is.
It could be, let's say for example, a power plant in the United States, or a chemical plant in Germany.
Would better be <unk>
And so we pulled out and <unk> the attack, and we discovered that it was <unk> in two bombs -- a small and a big one.
We also saw that they were very skilled with people who obviously had all the internal information.
They were all the dots to attack.
You probably even know how much they would take the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> is complex and high-tech technology, let me tell you, the payload is very complex.
It's very much above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code of attack.
We're talking about 15 lines of code.
It looks pretty much like old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find meaning to this code.
What we'd were looking at was called the functions of the system, because we know what they do.
We were looking at <unk> and we were looking for data structures and try to engage them with the real world, with potential potential targets in the world.
We need theories about recipients that we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals that we remember is definitely a violent <unk> has to be a white <unk> and it's certainly located in Iran, because it's where most infections have been <unk>
They don't find several thousand targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant of <unk> and the <unk> plant.
So I said to my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and power plants between our <unk>
I called them and I went back to an effort for <unk> their experience with what we find in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
<unk> is that cell part inside the <unk> that black object you see.
If you run the speed of this <unk> you can certainly be able to do it and even make it <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in an obvious effort to go back to the law engineers so that they couldn't solve this very quickly.
We try to figure out the big digital <unk> looking very close to the data and their structures.
So, for example, the number <unk> <unk> in that code, you can't <unk>
I started looking at scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and every waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That had sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called <unk>
And guess what we found in the code of <unk>
A <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had between your hands.
So it wasn't <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been transmitted by several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> on dead ends.
And yet, we found that both digital <unk> would say to one and the same goal, but from different <unk>
<unk> little is taking a <unk> and making <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and big <unk> it communicates with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're very confident that we've determined what is the <unk>
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We should not worry about other targets to be solved by <unk>
So here I show you some very interesting things that we saw -- I really hated me.
There is the gray box -- and you see the <unk>
What this thing is doing is <unk> the input of input from sensors for example, from the pressure sensors and the vibration sensors and provides <unk> code, which is still running during attack, with false data.
And believe it or not, these fake input data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like in the Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the safety camera feeds on video <unk>
Is it great <unk>
So the idea here is obviously not just <unk> the operators in the <unk>
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in a power plant, when the big steam turbine goes from speed, you have to open escape escape from a <unk>
Obviously, this can't do it a human operator to do it.
That's where we need digital security.
And when they're <unk> then you can go through bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And we don't have the <unk> and the security system is <unk>
That scares you.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically, with <unk> with <unk> <unk>
It could work too, for example, in a power plant, or a <unk>
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> to disseminate this burden with a <unk> <unk> like we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional <unk> technology for <unk>
<unk> as possible.
And if you made that, with what you <unk> is with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we need to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of targets such is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with large numbers of goals.
We need to face the consequences and better than we begin to prepare now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been done by a lot of sides that people assume that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What is your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, really want to listen to this?
Yeah. <unk>
My guess is that the <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the ultimate superpower, <unk>
There's one alone -- and that's the United States, fortunately, we <unk>
Because, in other ways, our problems would be even greater.
CA: Thank you, Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that can be able to take and give <unk> skills, or another thing to make users of wheelchair get up and walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They're not different than something you put in the morning, it gives you a big force, which is also increasing your speed, and helps for example, to handle the balance.
It's actually the actual integration of the man and the machine.
But not just that -- it can integrate it and connect it to the universe and with other reproductive things.
This is not a <unk> idea.
In order to show you now what we're working on with talking about the American soldier who, on average, has to take on their back a load of 45 pounds, and it's <unk> to get even more team.
Obviously, this leads to some major complications -- injuries on the back, in 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage from back.
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help handle the issue.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk> Human Human <unk>
Soldier: With the <unk> <unk> I can put it up 90 pounds of negative terrain for many hours.
Your flexible design, it allows you to get into <unk> <unk> and running movements with great <unk>
I know what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my force and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this appliance, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
Let's go back to the users of wheelchair chairs on what I'm particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people in chairs from wheels around the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens very often, people have damage to the spinal cord to start their life -- to the 20, 30 or 40 years -- they collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be its only choice.
We also talk about the population that is older than they multiply very quickly.
Her only option, many times -- for a brain injury or some other complication -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been this for the last 500 years, from the successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who did 19 years ago had an injury in the column, and as a result was unable to walk back 19 years now, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: So Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It has some sensors ...
It's completely not <unk> in the crutches that send signals into board, here on the back.
And then there are some batteries that give the motors to the <unk> and in the knees, and they make it move on with this smooth <unk>
AB: I was 24 years old at the top of my life when, for a strange jump in the air, on the air on the air on the bottom, it was <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost all of the feeling and all movement <unk>
So shortly after, a doctor went into my room in the hospital, and he said, "You will never go to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole the last bit of hope for my self.
The technology of adapting to me has allowed me to learn to <unk> it costs in <unk> climbing rocks and even riding <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, until now.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to affect future generations -- not just of soldiers, but at Amanda, and all the users of chairs from wheels to everyone.
AB: Thank you.
I just come back from a community that has the secret to human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say hello, and play is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the festival of Man <unk> or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, to meet their cousins.
This is the world of the wild Bonobos of rainforests in Congo.
The bonobos are, along with the chimpanzees, their living relatives closest to.
That means we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary musician, that lived about six million years ago.
Now, the chimps are known by their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've made too much emphasis on this aspect of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas chimpanzees are dominated by large, <unk> society is still in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special, because this leads to a very tolerant society, where the death violence is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes.
They live in the depths of the <unk> forest, and it's been very hard to <unk>
The Congo is a <unk> a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> scenario of a violent conflict that has been taken for decades and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
It's not surprising that this destruction will also put the survival of the Bonobo.
<unk> meat and deforestation are making it not fill in a stadium with the bonobos who stay in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos you can hear laughter hidden <unk> the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know that as the apes <unk> the love, not the <unk> because they have sex <unk> <unk> and <unk> to handle conflicts and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of the Bonobo is more than the <unk> <unk>
In <unk> as humans, they love to play throughout their lifetime.
Play isn't just a game of children.
For us and to play the game is fundamental to establish bonds and foster <unk>
We learn from <unk> and we learn the rules of the game.
The game increases creativity and resilience and it has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the game Bonobo that you see the <unk> roots of laughter -- the dance and the ritual conflict.
The game is the glue that comes together.
I don't know how they play you, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos from the wild.
First, it's a golf style, and I'm not talking about football.
Here is a female and a young male young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what she is doing.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, "I have <unk>
I just believe that I love him, right?
Yeah.
So sexual game is common both in bonobos as in humans.
And this video is really interesting because <unk> this video is really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements into the game -- like <unk> and also how play requires trust, and it <unk> the <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But play is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can adopt a lot of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young female -- which is playing with a <unk> water.
I think that, as it is, we sometimes play with each other, and we explore the limits of our inner worlds and outside.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, to interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just little samples of the understanding that Bonobos from our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future in which we have to adapt to a increasingly difficult world with more creativity and more cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these skills.
In other words, the game is our <unk> <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes we have to play.
But let's get to the most of our ability to game?
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
To bonobos and humans alike, not just cruel and <unk>
When it looks like the least appropriate thing play, you can be the most urgent moments of <unk>
So I was primates, for this gift of evolution and play together as they <unk> creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
So when I'm not fighting poverty, <unk> fires as a shipping assistant in a <unk>
And in our city, where volunteers tend to be a highly skilled staff, you have to get to the fire site very soon to get into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer in the site, so I had a pretty high chance of going.
But then there was a race against the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge and find out what our task was.
When I found the <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that certainly passed one of the worst days of his life.
We were at the end of the night, she was standing out of the rain, under a <unk> in her pajamas and her house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just arrived before me, <unk> <unk> <unk>  came first to the captain and he asked him to walk into the owner of the owner of the house.
The <unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or <unk> of money that during the rest of his life, he would have to tell the people who walked into a building on a burning building, just because I won for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to be in the house.
I need to be <unk> <unk> the fire, and bring this woman a pair of shoes."
I <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I expected but <unk> I got on the stairs, at the end of the hallway, I went to the <unk> at the end of the hall, which at that height or less had finished the fire and entered the main room for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my burden on the staircase where I met my <unk> and the beautiful dog on the front door.
<unk> the house on the house for the house where, as she was expected, her trove got a lot more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department received a letter from the house house <unk> by the brave effort to save her home.
The kindness that she looked at on everything else was that somebody had reached a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling on Robin <unk> as in my calling as firefighter firefighter I'm witness to generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also acts of grace and courage to the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
It all has its importance.
So, when I look in this room to people who have succeeded, or they're by <unk> remarkable levels of success would like to remind you this: I don't know.
Don't wait to win the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, <unk> right now.
<unk> food in a dining room, a neighborhood park.
They're mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save someone else's life, but each day we're going to be able to influence somebody's life.
So enter the <unk> <unk> shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
The first concrete blocks were built in <unk> with a very simple idea of cement of a fixed level that fit into each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build things bigger than us, like buildings or bridges, a brick at the time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, the <unk> came up with this.
It was called <unk>
And in a few years, the <unk> bricks.
It's estimated that over 400 billion or 75 <unk> per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges, buildings or houses.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> simply adopted the carbon block, the favorite in the world, and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small unit of plastic that would take us from a world of aesthetic <unk> piled on each other to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the carbon block, the transistor allows you to create much larger and more complex, a brick at the time.
But there's a <unk> difference, the transistor was just for experts.
I personally don't appreciate that the building blocks of our time are reserved for the experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started to explore the idea of bringing engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started to develop <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronic modules each one with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, motors and sensors.
And the best of all is that you get together by magnets.
So you can't place it in a wrong way.
<unk> have a colored code.
The green is the puzzle, the blue is the stream, the rose is the input and the color of color is wire.
So you only have to assemble a blue with green and very quickly and you can start to make higher circuits.
A blue one with green makes light.
We can put a button in the middle and we have a <unk>
If we change a button by a pulse, that is here, and now we have a <unk> light.
We put this <unk> to create more impact and we have a noise.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program, connect and <unk> <unk> allows us to program using very simple <unk>
To make <unk> faster or more quickly or more slow, just turn this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's a increasing growing.
We want all of the interactions in the world attached to <unk> <unk>
<unk> sounds, solar panels -- everything must be accessible.
We have given <unk> to the kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how they start to understand the electronics of every day that don't learn in schools.
For example, how does a sunlight work, or why the door of an elevator stays open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also led to design schools.
So, for example, designers have some electronics start playing with <unk> like a material.
Here you can see, with bottles of paper and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>  A few weeks ago, we took <unk> to the Rhode Island School designers who have no experience in engineering, just in cardboard, wood and paper and said, Make something.
Here's an example of a project that has done, an canyon <unk> <unk>
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> which is made out of the dark.
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, the electronics became another material.
And we want this material to reach all of you.
So <unk> has open source.
You can go on the website, download all of the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world we live in, this interactive world, is ours.
So forward and <unk>
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology industry.
And my little company seeks to get involved with the environment in the environment.
<unk>
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> Wait for a moment.
You can take a little bit in <unk>
<unk> we can get better on the video on a side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology.
Oh, I mean, I have a term for time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago I launched a initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that is supposed to be <unk> we asked them to work in government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like <unk> of Peace <unk>
We took some members every year and we put them to work with the <unk>
Instead of sending them to Third World -- we sent them to the wild world.
They did great <unk> worked with the <unk>
Their task is to show the possibilities of current technology.
<unk> <unk>
This is a hydrant park in Boston.
Here it comes up as if I would look for a date, but what it really looks for is that somebody got to clean up when it gets caught up by snow because he knows it's not very good where it is <unk> when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it come to ask for help in this way so <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that moment, we were very much last year.
They realized that the city never wiped these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> noticed something else: that citizens <unk> with <unk> the sidewalks right in front of them.
So he made a good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice app that you can adopt a <unk>
You accepts <unk> when you <unk>
In doing so, you put it a name, in this case put it <unk>
If you do it, someone can be <unk>
I mean, it has a component uprising.
It's a modest app.
Maybe it's the youngest of the 21 apps last year.
But it does something that no other technology of the <unk> government.
And it spreads <unk>
A responsible for systems of <unk> City to see this app was realized that he could use it, not for snow, but so that citizens get <unk>
It's very important to work these <unk> of the tsunami, but people steals the batteries.
So that's why the citizens are asking for the citizens who <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just came out of <unk> to get people to stand up to clean out sidewalks when they <unk>
So now we know about nine cities that we can use using it.
And this has spread without organic and natural ways.
If you know a little bit of government technology knows that this doesn't happen yet.
The acquisition of software generally takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool that parents could choose the best public school for their children.
Then they told us that they've done by normal channels it would have taken at least two years and cost about two million dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there's a project in the power of California that until the time has taken over 2,000 million dollars and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
So an app that you program in a couple of days and it spreads <unk> is a kind of a shot of warning to the institution of the government.
It suggests to the best ways to work, not as in private companies like a lot of people think it should be.
Not as a technological company, but rather as the Internet itself.
I mean, no constraints, in a open and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this application is that it represents the way to address the question of the government that has the new <unk> not as an issue of an <unk> institution as a collective action.
And that's very good because it turns out we're very good for collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools so that they were building together with efficacy.
And it's not just <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people all over the country that contribute to applications that contribute for applications -- every day in their own communities.
They've not been given to the government.
They feel a lot of frustration to that, but they don't get to <unk>
And these people know something that we've lost from sight.
And that is that if we leave the feelings about politics, the line in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of those other things that they put us nuts, the government is, essentially, in the words of Tim <unk> "What do we do together because it was alone in their own.
Now, a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it because things are changing.
The politics didn't recognize the government yes.
And because the government in the last aspect of us -- remember that <unk> the <unk> the way of thinking about it will affect the way that change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government was to choose people to make them <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is, above all, a matter of <unk>
This is the telephone care center of services and information.
It's the place that serves the calls if you make <unk> in the U.S.
Scott <unk> this call.
He joined the foundation of official knowledge.
I did nothing. It started with animal control.
And finally he said, "Hey, you can open the doors of the house, put it very hard and see if it was <unk>
And it worked. So it worked.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston is not a call center.
It has an <unk> and mobile phone called <unk> <unk>
They didn't have that app.
It was the work of very smart people from the Office of New York City, from Boston.
One day, this is actually coming up this <unk> <unk> in my cube -- I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do it for <unk>
The dynamic of <unk> <unk> is different.
Scott was talking to person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so you can all see this.
In this case, he saw a neighbor.
And the next one said, "I came up with the place, I found the cube behind the house.
<unk> Yes. <unk> Yes.
I went back the <unk> I went home.
Good nights, sweet <unk>
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of digital and physical play.
And it's also a great example of the government of the government to collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of the platform.
I'm talking about a platform for people to stand up and help others.
So, a citizen helped another but the government had a key role.
I connected the two people.
And it could have been connected with the government services of being necessary but the neighbor is a better and cheaper alternative than the government services.
When one neighbor helps another neighbor <unk> the communities.
If we call animal control, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we have to think about government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people do it, but think that one is the entrance to each other.
That our input to the government system is the vote.
How many times have you chosen a political leader, sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader, and then we hope that the government will take our values and get our values out, but then we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean, and politics is the <unk> shallow <unk>
That's why we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it's that <unk> that keeps us with that that we funded as something that operates in our against, that other thing, and in a result, we're losing power.
People believe politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work, we will have to make bureaucracy sexy.
Because this is where the real work happens.
We have to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the movement <unk>
They have been <unk>
It's a group of citizen citizens who have written a very detailed report of 325 pages in response to the request of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> on the financial reform.
That's not political activism -- it's activism <unk>
And for those of us that we have faced with government, it's time to ask us what world we want to leave our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they have to face.
Do you really believe that we get to where we need to go without solving the institution that can act on behalf of <unk>
We can't do without government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to be able to rethink the root function of government so that it can dramatically spread into civil society.
There is a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so hard to act <unk> we have only to articulate systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years old, so I was an older generation that many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up by taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face on who is going to be <unk> everyone's going to talk.
They can express your opinions in any channel at the same time and they do.
So when you face the government problem you don't care about to hear your voices.
They're using your hands.
They lay hands out to program applications that are going to work better for the government.
And those applications allow us to use our hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a <unk> out of <unk> <unk> a garbage cube that has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we could always have cleaned up those <unk> and a lot of people do it.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we're not only consumers, we're not only consumers of government that we pay taxes and we get services.
We are more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't look at the <unk>
So I want to ask everybody here, when it comes to the things that we need to do together, all together, we'll be a crowd of voices, or also we'll be a swarm of hands?
Thank you.
This is a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in the jails and the death row.
I've spent most of my life in <unk> communities in projects and places where there's a lot of despair.
And I'll be here at TED watching and hearing these stimuli for a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that they say here is impact all over the world.
But sometimes, if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that would not have otherwise.
I say this because I think identity is important <unk>
Here's fantastic.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if they teach them with feeling, they can have special meaning.
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> it can get much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in the practice, my work.
I learned it from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional <unk> family, dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was <unk> he had power.
It was the last word in all discussion in the family.
She <unk> many of the <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
Her parents were born in slavery in Virginia -- about <unk>
She was born on the <unk> and his experience with slavery to <unk> the way the world looked like.
She was <unk> but she was also <unk>
When I was a little bit like this, and I looked at her, and I was approaching a good hug.
I was so strong that I could barely breathe and then <unk>
One or two hours later, I would come back to <unk> I was approaching it, and he said, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if I said no, I was embarrassed again and if I said yes, I was leaving me in peace.
I had this human quality that I would always wish to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the lowest of 10.
Sometimes when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to capture his time and your attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight, nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
At first I thought it was a game.
And so I looked at him, and she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up through the room, I took my hand up and said, "Come on. The two are going to <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
It took me out and said, "You know, I'll tell you something, but you can't say it to <unk>
I said, "Okay, <unk>
She said, "Now I didn't get it. I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, I looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> who are <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you're going to do.
I'll never forget it.
Then he said to me, "Just want me to do three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want to tell you, is you always want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
As I went to my mom, I said, "Yeah, I said, "Yes, <unk>
Then he said to me, "The second thing I want to tell you, is that you will always do the right thing even though the right thing is it?
And I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk> So I am."
Then, finally he said, "The third thing I want you to tell you, is that I never want to be <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
I grew up in the field, in South rural. I have a brother a year and a sister a little year.
When I was 14, 15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> package and I don't know where the <unk> grabbed us my sister and me and we went for the forest.
We just got the <unk> of the usual <unk>
He took a drink of beer, offered her sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. It's okay. You <unk> but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> today <unk> And you always do the same thing as us.
I already took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What's up? Take a <unk>
I went up with strength and <unk> "Oh, not that you're thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that probably shouldn't say.
I know this is being <unk>
But I have 52 years old, and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I'm not saying this to be a <unk> I say it for the power of identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to others that they really don't see any sense.
We can't get them to do things that don't believe being able to do.
I think my grandmother would naturally believe that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner during the <unk>
My uncles died of diseases related to alcohol.
And these were the things that, according to her, we should have <unk>
Now, try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is today very different than it was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There are 2.3 million.
In the United States we have the largest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this mass <unk> in my opinion, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor or black communities, it's so much <unk> so much despair, determined by these facts.
One of three black men between the 18 and 30 years is in jail or parole.
In urban <unk> all over the country, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore -- Baltimore to 60 percent of all young people in color in jail or parole.
Our system is not only distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a court system that comes to you much better if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor, innocent.
It's not <unk> but wealth <unk>
And it seems to be very <unk>
The politics of fear and anger makes us believe that these are not problems.
We're <unk>
It seems interesting.
We're looking at our work -- some good curious.
In my state, in Alabama, as well as in other states, you provide rights for always if you have an criminal <unk>
Right now in Alabama, the <unk> population population has lost definitely the right to the vote.
And if we put it up to the next 10 years the level of the loss of rights to be as high as it was before they <unk> the law of the right to vote.
We have this amazing silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
America is the only country in the world where it was sentence to 13 years to die in prison.
We have in this country jail for children, no possibility of being done.
Now we're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
Tell people in the death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In a certain sense, they've been given to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by the <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another form of <unk> it is not about deciding whether people deserve to die for crimes -- but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
<unk> death is defined by mistake.
From every nine people <unk> has identified an innocent man who is <unk> and released from the death <unk>
A <unk> rate -- <unk> an innocent guy in nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation it wouldn't be allowed to be able to fly airplanes if they were in nine to <unk> you would have <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of whether we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students on <unk> history, I'm talking about slavery at all.
I'm talking about terrorism, the time that started at the end of the rebuilding and that lasted to the Second World War.
We really don't know a lot about this.
But for the black Americans in this country, it was a bit defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
They were worried about being <unk>
The threat of terror was what defined their lives.
Now there are older people who come to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you ask of talks, you ask of talks, people who stop saying that in our history for the first time with terrorism, after <unk>
They ask me to say, "No.
The age of terrorism went on, obviously, with the segregation and decades of compassion and separation.
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And this is why we haven't understood what we have historically done.
All of the time we lived around with each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs us to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they could not overcome racial segregation without a commitment to truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide they had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany to talk about death row.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "You know it's well disturbing to listen to what they <unk>
<unk> "Don't have death row in Germany.
We could never be here."
The room was quiet and a lady said, "There's no way that we have our history, we could ever get into systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we, <unk> and <unk> would put us to <unk>
Let me think about this.
How would we feel about a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were in their most <unk>
We could not get it back.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there's this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these things so difficult, the positive and wonderful things they are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
We're fascinated by technology.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are driven by suffering, abuse, abuse, <unk> <unk>
In my opinion, we need to integrate two things.
I've been talking about the need to have more hope, greater commitment, more commitment, to the basic challenges of life in this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the ones that never come to TED.
If you think about them is, in a way, something that is inside our being.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are. In spite of being so rational, so committed to the intellectual thing.
With innovation, and development comes not just about brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> ideas, also by the <unk>
This connection of mind with the heart is what drives us to look at not just how bright and <unk> but also in the dark and the tough thing.
<unk> <unk> the great leader was talking about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe suffering from <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but mainly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a will to be in places of despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much at the heart of what I believe, that even in communities like TED, should be <unk>
There's no disconnect related to technology and design, that allowed us to truly be human, if we don't pay attention to poverty, to poverty, to <unk> to injustice.
Now I want to tell you that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we ignored these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege, being a very young lawyer -- to meet Rosa <unk>
These women were together, just to talk.
Occasionally, Jewish lady was called me to go, <unk> come up with Mrs. <unk> We're going to get together to speak.
Do you want to come and get it.
He said, "I know I do."
So she said, "Well, what are you going to do when you <unk>
I read <unk>
So I was going to go and just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple hours, Ms. Parks went to me and said, "Now, "Now, tell me that this idea of justice <unk>
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started giving my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to challenge injustice.
We try to help those who have been convicted of <unk>
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in management of criminal justice administration.
We try to end up with the sentences sentences of life, without freedom for the kids.
We try to do something about death.
We try to reduce the population in prison.
We try to end the <unk> <unk>
I gave all my best speech, and he looked at me and said, "You know, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk>
At that time, Ms. <unk> <unk> me put my finger on the face and said, "It's why you have to be very much too <unk>
I think actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We have to find the way to address those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because eventually humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated on simple things.
I have come to understand and to believe that each of us is higher to the worst thing that we have <unk>
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't belong to you, it's not that it's a <unk>
Even, if someone kills another, it's not that it's a <unk>
So this is why I think there's a basic dignity in people who should be <unk> by law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
That's what it is.
I really think that in many parts of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that even though it's very beautiful, very <unk> very <unk> very <unk> not to judge our technology, by our designs, and because of our intellectual capacity or rational.
By the end, the character of a society, not because of the way they treat the rich, powerful and <unk> but because of how they treat the poor, the <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
I feel like I am <unk> I'm going to finish with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
<unk> tired, like everyone.
Sometimes those ideas are beyond my <unk> in an important way.
I've been representing these kids who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my clients at 13 and 14 years old, which have been <unk> for them as adults do.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge judge someone in what isn't it?
The judge would make it as an adult, but I see a child.
One night later, I was up to wake up, for God, if the judge can turn you into something you are not from, must have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask for some of that.
As I was very late, I couldn't think correctly, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a <unk> a <unk> black.
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> for my <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In <unk> I put there there had been <unk> <unk> in the <unk> in the behavior of the police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country there is no ethics, but a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream or really <unk>
For my horror, not just <unk> he had sent him to court.
For about two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally <unk> Oh God, I have to go to court for this case.
I got on the car and I felt truly <unk> <unk>
I went back to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally came out of the car. He walks to court.
I was going up the stairs when I found myself with a black man <unk> was the <unk> of court.
When he saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> He said, "It's you. I said yes.
And so I approached it and I was shocked.
And I stood up in the ear, you know.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That was deeply connected with my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I walked into the audiences.
When I walked in, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this audacity <unk>
I said, "Yes, Mr. <unk> And we started argumentation.
People started to get there. They were <unk>
I was the one who had written those <unk>
They came the cops the prosecutors <unk> <unk> <unk>
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people -- all odds, because we talked about races, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the eye of the eye I was brought to see the <unk> which was going and <unk>
And they would look down the window and let me hear all that <unk>
I want to walk around here and over there.
Finally, this old black, with a worry, I went into the room and sat behind me, almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge <unk> a <unk>
During the break a <unk> he was upset because the <unk> had entered the room.
The <unk> ran over the old black <unk>
And he said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk> hall.
And the old black man stood up, he looked at me and he looked at me and said, "I went to this <unk> room to tell this young man who keep his view in the goal with <unk>
I've come to TED today because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds towards justice.
We cannot be truly human <unk> if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is linked to each other.
What our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity must lead to the <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, those of the people here who share this, I just want to tell you to keep the view in the goal with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> to hear and see an obvious desire for the audience of this community, to help in your purposes of doing something.
Something that's not a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are several close opportunities there.
If you live in the California state -- for example, there's going to be a <unk> this spring in which you will do an effort to save the funds that are spent today in punishment.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars in death row in the next five years, a billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of cases in homicide not in <unk>
The rapes don't get to nothing.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to propose that these funds are going to get the law to make the law, to safety.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it tells you that it has to do with the greatest rate of <unk>
What would you say that this is this?
<unk> Actually, the rate of <unk> with violence has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in mass <unk> in this country is not for crimes with violence.
It's for the wrong war of drugs.
That's why this dramatic increase in the <unk> population.
And we let us convince the rhetoric of the punishment.
We have three legal causes to lead people to supply chain to steal a bicycle, for small crimes against property, instead of making those resources to their victims.
I think we have to do more to help the victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy about punishment does nothing about anyone.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> you've been excited to be excited about here.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.
<unk> <unk> the threats for Bin Laden.

Oh, my God!
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips I got in the last six months -- <unk> could be the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that the media means <unk> <unk> negative news because our minds pay attention to them.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of each day our senses are getting many more data than probably the brain can be <unk>
And as nothing matters more than to survive, the first stop of all those data is an old clip of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector, the <unk> detector.
<unk> and recorded all of the information for something in the environment that we could get damage.
So for that of a <unk> stories of stories to look at the negative.
That old saying of <unk> "If there are blood blood, it's very true.
And because of all digital devices give us negative news give us negative news, 24 days a day, 24 hours a day, no wonder we are <unk>
It's not surprising that people think that the world is going to be wrong with worse.
But maybe it's not.
Maybe, in change, what really happens is that we get <unk>
Perhaps enormous progress done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good issues -- climate change, the species of species, the <unk> of water and <unk> <unk>
As human beings are very good at overcoming the problems, and in the long run, we just ended up with them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has been more than <unk> the average income per capita income has <unk> all over the world.
Child mortality has shrunk 10 times.
In addition, the cost of food, of transportation and communications, has fallen 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living the most peaceful time in human history.
And Charles <unk> that the world's literacy went from 25 to over 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people do it.
And we continue to get more and higher expectations.
In fact, <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in America, much of the people living under the poverty line have electricity, water, toilets, <unk> television, etc., air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the past century, the <unk> of the planet, would never have dreamed of such <unk>
It's a lot of this technology -- and then it's given this exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that <unk> in information technology jumps into this curve, Moore's Law -- and it's doubling the price of the price in about 12 to 24 months.
That's why the mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer in the 1970s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things on this curve.
First of all, the soft thing is -- in good and bad times, in war and peace, in depression and <unk>
It's the outcome of fast computers used to build computers.
It doesn't stop any of the big challenges.
And even though it's <unk> in a law on the left, it's curve up.
The growth rate of technology is increasingly fast.
And in this curve, to <unk> Moore's Law -- there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have today.
The computation in the cloud, that my friends of <unk> are called infinite computing and sensors and networks, and 3D printing and <unk> of personalized production -- all over the planet, synthetic biology, the fuels and the food, the digital medicine, the <unk> and the <unk>
I mean, how many saw the victory on "Jeopardy" Watson, from <unk>
It was spade.
I tried to <unk> the best headline than <unk>
And I loved this: I was going to interview him for 54 societies.
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
It plays with the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for every cell phone.
Four years ago, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can they be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or service, that can be positively affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think about creating abundance, it doesn't mean to create life <unk> for every <unk> is about creating a life of as possible.
It's about taking that that is scarce and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
Let me give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon <unk> in the <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> the king of <unk>
<unk> troops with <unk> of silver, and the same <unk> with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate with <unk>
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal of the planet, it was worth more than gold and <unk>
So that's why the tip of the reverberation is <unk>
You see, even though aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come like <unk>
It's tied up by oxygen and <unk>
But then he got the <unk> and made of aluminum something so cheap that we use it as if it was <unk>
So let's take this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on a <unk> planet, for 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They come to Earth 16 <unk> of energy every <unk> minutes.
It's not about care, it's about <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy dropped 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows you that in the end of the decade, in the United States of the United States, solar electricity will cost six cents an hour compared to the 15 cents of national average.
And if we have abundance of energy we also have a lot of water.
Let's talk about wars for water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan pointed to the Voyager <unk> in 1990, after I spent <unk>
<unk> a very famous picture, how do you <unk>
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a water planet.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent of water.
Yes, the <unk> is saltwater, the two percent is ice, and we fought for the water <unk> of the planet, but there is also a hope.
It's a technology available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes the nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators of the <unk> I'd like to share with you, I gave me permission to <unk> your technology called <unk> <unk> -- already <unk> is the size of a small refrigerator size.
It is able to generate a thousand gallons of drinking water by the day of any source -- saltwater, saltwater, water <unk> for less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola has just thought that I'm going to make a significant test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out right, and I have full confidence that so that we would be, Coca-Cola is going to be in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an <unk> innovation.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
My God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration of mobile phones in the developing world for the end of 2013.
<unk> that warrior <unk> has better mobile communications in the middle of Kenya that the president Reagan 25 years ago.
And to tell with a smart phone with Google, he has access to more knowledge and information than the Clinton President 15 years ago.
She lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that no one could have predicted before.
So better than that, the things that you and I have paid tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- video, <unk> images, <unk> images, <unk> images, of <unk> diagnostic technology -- now <unk> and lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best thing comes to you when your health care is.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation, which is called the X <unk> <unk> <unk>
We are challenging the teams of the world to make these technologies into a mobile device that they speak, and because they have <unk> they can be extracted from your finger.
To win it has to make better diagnoses than a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there's no doctors, where the <unk> load is 25 percent of the health care workers.
When this device <unk> a virus of RNA or DNA that will not be able to call the <unk> and first of all, avoiding the pandemic.
But this is the biggest force to produce a world of abundance.
I call it the <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
We've just gone through the <unk> of the seven billion billion.
By the way, the best protection against the demographic explosion is to provide the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, spending about two billion to five billion Internet users.
Three billion minds have never happened before you add to global conversation.
What would these people?
What do you do? What would you need?
And instead of economic collapse we'll have the largest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And <unk> of more health thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy and because of the use of 3D impressions and the computation in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we give us 3,000 billion members of human humanity, educated and <unk>
How about some voices never <unk>
What if we give the oppressed. wherever you are, a voice to be heard and be heard by being heard of <unk>
What do we do? These three billion?
And if they're contributions that we can't afford to.
One of the things that I learned with the X is that small equipment, guided by their passion with a goal of course, can do things -- things that could only do the big corporations and governments.
I'm going to finish by sharing a story that really excites me.
There's a program that maybe some of you heard of.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how you fold protein.
<unk> determine structure and functionality.
It's a very important thing to medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They have played by these university professors, among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people joined each other, and they started <unk>
And it has been shown to have been shown today that the machinery of human patterns is better by folding proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power as people in order to take major challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of the innovative <unk>
We have the capital of the <unk>
And we have three billion new minds that we are going to do to work on the solution of big challenges and do what we should do.
We have in front of a few decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very powerful idea.
<unk> <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before you give you three examples for a time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that <unk> <unk> but it didn't.
It actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as very <unk>
It was <unk>
He caught a lot to the <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red <unk> of <unk>
But we've heard this story many times, about Galapagos and other places, so that doesn't have anything special.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The brochures are still saying they keep <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a lagoon in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned a lot with the sun and I was convinced that I was not there.
This is my first exhibition to the sun.
<unk> was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, about <unk>
There was about 20 kilometers a black beard <unk>
And the fishery of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good moment, so I was getting more than a half in Ghana.
When I was there 27 years later the number of fish had gone down in half.
I went back to five centimeters tall.
It will be a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to changed, but it's all changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of fishing fishing in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s he started in <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
And development was meant to impose the countries that already had 100,000 <unk> <unk> industrial fishing.
And this boat, pretty bad -- he called the <unk> four.
I went to fish in it, and we did studies in the south of China <unk> and above all, in the <unk> Sea.
What we capture was something <unk>
<unk> now, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we captured were <unk> other animals that are in the background.
And most fish are tiny blobs on a <unk> remains that are <unk>
In short, the bottom of the sea came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In a year, you do a study and then you start the commercial fishing.
The bottom of being a soft bottom of the soft coral -- in this case, a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
Not the <unk> <unk> because they were dead.
Once we captured a alive.
I was still not <unk>
So they wanted to <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what the fishermen are collected every time they have never fish.
But it's not <unk>
<unk> the world, but we don't remember it.
It will be <unk> the start of start to the new level, not remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the Y-axis, we have something -- biodiversity, how many <unk> the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation will use the images to the beginning of their conscious life as the normal and the <unk> forward.
The difference is that they perceive loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the accumulation of changes.
And at the end, keeping some <unk> remains.
And that, in great extent, is we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that they don't are, or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies are killing animals without knowing what they've done until a few generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal that is very abundant before <unk> is <unk>
You don't lose animals.
You lose animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a great loss.
Over time, we focus on the big animals, and in a sea synonymous with big fish.
They become <unk> because <unk>
Over time you have a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> who was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in a previous way is not the way they would expect that evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some <unk> like Captain such as Captain and so I observed a lot of fish in this area can't be used or generally they don't use the scientists of fishing, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in <unk> societies, because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
From there the huge role that he can fulfill a protected marine area.
Because with the <unk> marine areas -- we really recreating the past.
<unk> the past that people can't conceive of because the starting point has run down and it's incredibly low.
That is for people who can see a protected marine area and they can benefit from the vision that we can make it <unk> which allows them to erase their <unk>
And what about people who can't do it because they don't have access, like people in the Middle Midwest, for example?
I think there are the arts and cinema maybe fill in the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of the Bay Area.
A long time ago, there were gray whales in <unk> Bay.
And you may have noticed that <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were just moved with the movie <unk> to talk about the story of <unk> why do we <unk>
Because it raises something that, in a sense, it has been lost.
And so my <unk> the only one to give, is to Cameron <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hello. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> tendencies manager and look at YouTube videos in a professional form.
It's true.
So now we're going to see why videos are making viral and what importance has that.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed very, very hard.
But now the web video today makes any of us, or of our actions, copper in a part of our global culture.
Any one can be made famous on the Internet in a <unk>
They get over 48 hours of video to YouTube for a minute.
And, of those, only a small percentage gets viral up a myriad of views and it makes a cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: I creators with trends, and surprise.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh, my God, my God.
Oh my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video outside of his house in the Yellowstone National Park.
In 2010, it was 23 million times.
This graph shows the views at the rise of the past summer.
<unk> didn't write a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double <unk>
That's what you do if you call <unk> Mountain <unk>
I had already published many videos of nature.
This video was published in January.
So what happened here?
He was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> he published this question that he <unk> the popularity of the marriage.
The makers of trends like Jimmy <unk> we have some new things and interesting things and <unk> to a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  He's Friday, Friday. You have to start on Friday.   Everyone wants to get the end of a week, the weekend.   <unk> Friday. <unk> Friday.  KA: You will not think that we can have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> by Rebecca <unk> is one of the most popular videos of the year.
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows how often we use use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to be emerged from nowhere.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask for those other <unk> they're also Friday.
But what happened this day, this particular Friday day.
Well, it took <unk> and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> of <unk> Science Science was one of the first people to do a joke about the video on Twitter.
But what's important is that a person or an creators group embrace a point of view, and they share it with a larger audience, accelerating the process.
So, this community of people who shares this big <unk> then starts talking about that and do things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each of the other days.
Unlike the 20th century, the 20th century, this communal participation is our way to be part of the phenomenon -- or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an <unk> animation with an <unk> music.
That's it. That's it.
This year they saw about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare, you know that there is a <unk> version that has been seen four million times.
Even the cats saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats see the video.
But what's important here is the creativity that aroused between the Internet <unk> community.
There was <unk>
Somebody made an version of the old one.
And then it became international <unk>
Suddenly, a whole community of <unk> that made this happen to be a dumb joke to something that we can all form part.
Because today not only are you going to be <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> or file, Black or <unk>
What script could have been written to be written by this situation?
In a world where two days of video you go up with a minute, just that really unique and unexpected can be <unk> the way these things have done.
When a friend told me that I had to look at this big video of a kind of video that we protest against <unk> in New York City, admit I didn't really get interested in it.
Casey <unk> I was <unk> by not circular by the <unk> but we often have obstacles that you prevent you properly on the <unk>
KA: Thank you the surprise of surprise and its humor, Casey <unk> I managed to get five million and understand her idea.
So this approach is worth up for all of the new things we do <unk>
And all of this leads us to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The creators of makers of participation, completely unexpected, are features of a new kind of media -- which we all have access to and is the audience that defines the popularity of it.
As I said before, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin Justin started on YouTube.
Don't you get permission to express your ideas.
Now we are all a little <unk> of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of old media -- it's just the current media -- but we have the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that is still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a lifetime.
It's a poet, a man whose entire life had been supported by the only unit and freedom of their country.
<unk> as the <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
The words, for so much time friends, I will do it.
They become silent.
He died broken by history.
He's my grandfather.
I never knew.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that history tried to <unk> but it would happen.
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at dawn <unk> <unk> into the sea.
My mother, <unk> was just 18 years old when his father died, and a <unk> marriage and two little girls.
For her, life had been meant to a <unk> task and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her that I couldn't do it.
And after a <unk> four years that defies fiction, a boat was blown away towards sea dressed dressed up to sea <unk>
All the adults knew the risks.
The greatest fear were the <unk> the rape and death.
Like most adults, my mother had a <unk> with poison.
So if we got out, first we'd take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rate of the engine, the <unk> diving into every wave, and the vast and empty horizon.
I don't remember the pirates who came several times, but they were <unk> with the courage of men in our boat, or the engine dying and not to be able to tear for six hours.
But I can remember the lights of the oil shelf in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, she was too much to get it, and the first apple I tried to, given for the men on the platform.
No apple had after the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations making a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a suburb of <unk> class, whose population is comprised of prisoners.
Unlike the middle class in the middle class, whose existence I was in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The odor that came from the stores were the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English <unk> was <unk> among people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then on a car assembly line, working six days, <unk> turn.
Yet, I found time to study English and get a title in IT <unk>
We were poor.
All of the dollars were <unk> and established an extra mentoring in English and mathematics, wouldn't mind what it should be <unk> which was generally <unk> it was always a second hand.
Two pairs of average for school, one to hide the holes in the other.
A school uniform to the <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there was very rare and <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> <unk>
So we go home, where?
Something in me <unk>
I was accumulating and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we got on our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother in the house.
My mother had <unk> all the boat.
And my task was to be awake until his nightmares are starting to be able to be <unk>
She opened a computer store, then studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And women would come with their stories about men who couldn't make the transition and angry and angry kids trapped between two worlds.
They looked for subsidies and <unk>
And they created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was a relentless <unk> student, relentless with what I <unk> from myself.
On the other, I was <unk> in the lives of <unk> caves, <unk> for violence, drug abuse and isolation.
But many of them received help through the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year, I chose the young Australian young of the year.
And I was <unk> from one piece of the puzzle to the other, but its edges, not <unk>
<unk> a <unk> resident was now now <unk> refugee and social activist invited to talk about sites that I had never heard of, and in houses whose existence she'd ever imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use the <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into the <unk> and the comfort of life in a <unk> suburb -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters ending the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of each one and <unk> <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom who couldn't do it.
I reminded me that I had now the same age as she was when we got the boat.
It had never been an option.
<unk> told me, "and you're not what you don't know.
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> the marginalized and the <unk>
And the more frankly, the more I was talking about was <unk> to talk.
I met people from all the paths of life, many of them doing what they were living on the border of the possible.
And even though I ended up my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a race race.
I had to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's well going to be a stranger, a new approach to the scene -- and not just that it's fine, but it's something that is being grateful, maybe a gift of the ship.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
He gave the enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world is <unk> but not the way we fear it.
They didn't have been <unk> they were <unk> tremendously.
There was a energy there, an <unk> optimism is a very humility and <unk>
So I kept my intuition.
<unk> to a small group of people who <unk> <unk> can't <unk> it was a challenge.
For a year we had a <unk>
At the end of every day, I was doing a giant pot of soup that all <unk>
<unk> at the night.
Most of our ideas were crazy, but a few brilliant ones, and we open up to us.
I made the decision to move to the U.S.
After one journey.
My <unk>
Three months later, I had <unk> and the adventure.
Before the end, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time where the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared.
Life had not changed for centuries.
Her father died shortly after she was born.
The mother grew up alone.
The 17 became a <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
No support of his husband, it caused a <unk> to <unk> and bringing the cause she itself, and a lot more <unk> caused when he won.
You can't get it wrong.
He was in the shower in a hotel room in <unk> when she died, to <unk> <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I saw it standing on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called a minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around her <unk>
We tell the stories and make sure we were still with it.
At night a monk came up and told us that I had to close the <unk>
My mother asked her to raise their hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why is her hand hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
Because you've taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
They have not <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Because of us who we were and how life came up with us, we can now see that the men who had come to our lives would have been <unk>
The defeat was very easily.
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the boat.
Who could wish that for you?
However, I fear the privilege of the easy, the right.
Can I give you a <unk> in your lives, diving brave in every wave, the <unk> rate of the motor, the vast horizon that you can't secure nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could take it and see them safe, I would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of <unk> here in the fourth or fifth row.
My story starts in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky.
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed since the age of ancient Indian <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when the Indians wanted to travel <unk> a car and <unk> the sky.
Now we do it with aircraft.
And at that time, when we <unk> the great Indian warrior prince was <unk> pulled out a bow and with a <unk> to the ground, I could find water.
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we had was the machinery had replaced with magic.
And that struck me so much.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I would give you this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciating a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't afford my friends.
It seemed to me that technology had to allow magic, I don't know.
As a kid my grandfather gave me his <unk> silver <unk>
And this piece of technology was for my most magic thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of hackers and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that cell phone, the luxury clocks and the cameras prevent them from <unk>
We love our inspiration.
So I was struck by that <unk> I was brought to this technological world to see how to use it to create magic, instead of <unk>
<unk> books from the 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad I saw a <unk> device able to connect to the readers of the entire world.
You can know how to take the book, you know?
Where do we are.
I put the text together with the image, animation and touch.
The storytelling becomes increasingly <unk>
But what does that do?
I'm about to launch an interactive app for the iPad.
He says, <unk> your fingers on each light."
And so --  He says, "This box is <unk> I write my name.
And so I get a character in the book.
At a number of moments it comes to me -- the iPad knows where I live through GPS -- which is led to me.
My inner little girl gets excited with all these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean magicians and dragons, but to that childhood magic to those ideas that we <unk>
For some reason, fireflies in a jar I always became exciting.
So over here, we have to shift the iPad to release the fireflies.
And really, they light up your way in the rest of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated by a little girl was that a whole galaxy is going into a <unk>
So here, every book and every world turns into a <unk> that I drag into this magical device inside the device.
And this opens up a map.
In all of the fantasy book has always been maps but static maps.
This is a map that goes up, <unk> and guides you over the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book it was also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another very important aspect to me is to create Indian content and the contemporary time.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of the fairies and the <unk> but how many people outside India know their counterparts -- <unk> <unk>
These poor people have been trapped in the cameras of Indra for millennia, in an old and <unk> book.
So we're bringing them back into a children's story.
In a story that's about current issues like the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems in the last 10 years has been that kids have been <unk> attached to their <unk> they've not come to the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can pull our kids to the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure that we need to go outside the outside, take the camera or iPad, and collecting images of different natural objects.
As a child, I had a lot of <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For some reason kids aren't doing it.
So to reclaim this childhood ritual we have to go out and, in a chapter, we would have a picture of a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So it creates a picture digital photos that you can then put on the Web.
A kid in London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, today I saw a <unk>
A boy in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photos that have been taking.
Within the variations of connection between magic, Earth and technology are many possibilities.
In the next book we had to have an interaction in which you go out with the iPad and video on and through and through <unk> <unk> a group of cartoons that appear on the inner plants in the house.
At a moment, the screen is full of leaves out.
And you have to do the sound of the wind and get it to be able to read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world where the forces of nature are <unk> with technology and magic and technology will come to each other.
It takes the power of the sun.
We're approaching our children and ourselves to the natural world and that magic, joy and child love that sat through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects.
And I think, really, the most important thing about that is we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University of <unk> was <unk> to a listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or tea and asked patients, family and <unk> What would you say?
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think, that this is one of the biggest problems that all of us, or maybe not all, but most of the projects of <unk> they fail, because we stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi scale -- it's a very simple thing.
It has a <unk> doorknob and scale.
Every morning I was <unk>
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I put the challenge to get to 95 percent.
But it is so simple, that every time I <unk> it sends my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my weight problem is, not at the same time that I need assistance -- or any urgency to that style that, but to see it backwards.
But there's something else.
As some of you know, I have more than 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi scale and before I go up to my car, people start to <unk> <unk> I think you need a light lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure for the pairs used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients to stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move people from their chairs and together develop some activity that is going to have more control of their health.
From the next week.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people will go from their houses, take their blood pressure, <unk> their doctor, and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients take a position, they come back to recover control and being captains of their own <unk> but it can also help us care about health because of the challenges that we face, as the firing of health care costs <unk> <unk> and other issues.
We have techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients on the team.
And they can do it with techniques like this, but also by <unk>
And one of the things we did, I would like to share it with you with a video.
We all have navigation checks in <unk>
Maybe we even have in our phones.
We know perfectly where machines are <unk>
Where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find fast food.
But where is the closest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked but no one <unk>
Nobody knew where to get the <unk> saves lives at this time.
What we did was do <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public <unk> you see a <unk> please <unk> <unk> where, and when it's open, because sometimes they open up in <unk> and others are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> were already presented in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the application for that.
And we made an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and someone <unk> you can use their iPhone, and you can use your <unk> cell phone to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I would like to present this one, not just as a <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as a <unk>
And we want to make it globally <unk>
We are <unk> all the colleagues in the world, at other universities, so that we can help us find and act as a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Every time you're on vacation and somebody <unk> it can be a relative or somebody in front of you, you can find it.
I also want companies to invite companies around the world that could help us verify these <unk>
You could be <unk> or <unk> people for example, to see if the <unk> which is shown is still in its place.
Please focus on this and not just improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photography.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, they are photographs that can't take with their cameras.
My interest in photography was woke up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
He mixed with my little passion before the drawing but it was a little bit different because when I used the camera that the process was on the planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera that the process ends up when the <unk>
For me photography had more to do with being in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed like anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start when you press the <unk>
<unk> like this: an building on a very <unk> road.
But it has an unexpected twist on it.
And yet, it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful people, but with the common goal of keeping the <unk>
And when I say realism I say <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something that can be done, but I always want it to have been captured in a way like photography.
You know, you have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to take an idea that we have to capture a moment.
But what is the trick that makes it real?
They're the details or the <unk>
<unk> the light?
What is the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But in the end, it's our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive it on a <unk> surface.
It's not really about whether it's realistic but what we think is a realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of the reality that we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> objects, something that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in some way you can create something that still seems like <unk> as I existed.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
And so you get to the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that it doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's really about combining different realities.
And the things that make a picture seem to be realistic and I think they're those in which we don't even perceive things around us in our daily lives.
But when I combine photographs is very important -- because otherwise something is going to be wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to achieve realistic outcomes.
As you can see, these pictures are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective.
Secondly, the photos are <unk> you must have the same kind of light.
And these two images meet these <unk> they were taken to the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make it impossible to distinguish the beginning and the end of the different images with a perfect voice.
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
Here's another example.
So you might think that this is the picture of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this picture is totally composed of photographs of different places.
And in the personal way, I think it's easier to create a place that can find it because you don't need to put in danger the ideas that have on your head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought this idea in the winter knew that I had several months to try to find out the different locations for the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing trip.
The shores are a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a rock.
And yes, I even made the house from the top of the island to look more <unk>
So to achieve a realistic outcome I think it takes to try to make a difference.
You always start with a <unk> an idea.
Then we need to combine the different pictures.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures the result can be very beautiful and the very <unk>
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'm going to start showing a slide on technology, very boring.
Please if you can <unk>
It's a diagram that anybody took from my mine.
I'm not really interested in showing you the details but the general side.
This is a analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus power of local local area.
What's interesting about this is that this one, as many other we tend to see, is a straight line on the <unk> scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude on the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> <unk> is something new.
This is something weird happening.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please light the lights.
It's more intensity because writing on paper.
Why are we <unk> technological curves at the scales.
The answer is that if I draw it in a normal curve where I say, these are the years, or some of the time, and this would be any of the time of technology that I would like to look at the diagram is something ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
He doesn't tell a lot.
But if you could imagine for example, some other technology, like transport, on a <unk> curve, it would be very silly. We see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives you a <unk> change.
If technology technology is as fast as we were in the last morning tomorrow we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go through that rhythm.
There is no <unk> in the history of technological development that every few years advance orders of magnitude.
The question I want to pose is -- looking at these <unk> curves we see that they don't follow forever.
It's not possible to hold this change as fast as it goes.
So let's get one of two things.
Or it's going to be converted into a typical know like this until it comes to something completely different, or maybe it will do something like that.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, that's why I think maybe will happen something like this.
So now we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what the world used to be the world, in a new way.
And so what I'm trying to ask, is what is that new way for the world?
Why new state is going on the world?
The transition seems very, very confused if we're engaged in it.
I remember that the future was happening in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future and we see that the future is still the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel something going on.
And we can feel a transformation.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything will be so different to extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how that might be, how that transition to <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and look at things in the long term.
The time scale that I'd like to do that is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at it every billion years.
So you go back about 2.5 billion years when the Earth was a big <unk> rock with lots of chemicals around them.
If we look at the way that those chemicals organized those chemicals we give us an idea of how things came out.
And I think there are theories to begin to understand the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this -- and that's that, at that time, there were a little bit of oil oil with all sorts of giant chemical recipes inside it.
Some of those oil droplet had a particular combination of chemicals that made them to bring out the outside of the outside and so the drops grew up in the <unk>
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the most expensive cell forms -- those <unk> of oil.
But those blobs were not alive in the current sense, because each of them contained a random prescription for chemicals.
And every time they were <unk> <unk> a distribution of the chemicals that are going on.
So every <unk> was a little bit different.
In fact, the drops that somehow will be better at the time of adding the chemical <unk> <unk> more and more <unk> more chemicals and <unk>
Mostly, they lived more time, they were more <unk>
It was a form of life, living chemistry, but things become interesting when these blobs learned the trick of abstraction.
In some way that we don't really understand very well these <unk> learned to store information.
They learned to save information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemist called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this evolutionary evolution -- a writing system that allowed them to record what they were in order to be <unk>
And the amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, our genes, they have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living will be expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just by <unk> Now we can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of white dust that I try to hide the airport security.
But <unk> Tom <unk> The code has the most common letters that we tend to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data in this piece of DNA and <unk> 10 to the 22 times.
So if somebody wants 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot of the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and it's here.
If it was a <unk> I would have put it in a virus and would have spread it through the room.
What was the next <unk>
So writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells be happy another billion years old.
But then another big step happened in which things were very excited about that things are very different, and it was that these cells started trading and communicate information in which cell communities.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So for example, for example, evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found the way to avoid penicillin in the way that we could avoid penicillin and to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there are many resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication led to the communities that, in a way, they were put together and established a <unk>
In that <unk> way, or <unk> together, or whether if a community was very successful all the individuals of that community would become more and <unk> by evolution.
And the tipping point occurred when these communities came up so much that, in fact, they came together and decided to write the whole recipe for the community board in a chain of DNA.
The next stage interesting for life led to another billion years.
And in that stage we have <unk> communities of many different kinds of cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
Your skin cell doesn't serve without the heart of the heart, or in the brain, or so on.
So these communities evolved and produced more interesting levels than cell phone, which we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These started to <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that they didn't make information in community.
They're <unk> structures.
The neurons are the devices that process the information that those cell communities built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the responsible structures of <unk> to understand and convey the information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that time as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the time period of evolutionary time.
So, an organism could, for example, learn not to eat some fruit because he knew bad and got sick the last time he ate it.
That could happen during the life of a organism that had previously built these information processing structures that by evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit.
So the fact that the nervous system actually built those information structures that accelerated the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in time you need to learn.
But then, of course, individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So, for example, the most <unk> version that we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
And I have a very complicated idea, an idea in the head.
I'm here sitting here emitting <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, <unk> and <unk> in his heads that keeps some analogy with mine.
But we take something very complicated to turn it into sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start to work as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started to perform <unk>
Now we go through periods of similar periods to the <unk> organisms, which is our <unk> testing and information processing methods.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The <unk> the <unk> tape tape -- the <unk> and so forth, is the specialized mechanisms that we now build to handle that information.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in microseconds.
You saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> where there was some evolution with the <unk> program in front of our eyes.
And now we've accelerated the time scales again.
The first stages of the story that I would tell you to take a billion years each.
The next few stages, and the brain, took a few hundred million years old.
The next one, the language, and so on. It took less than a million years.
And these days, like electronics, it seems to take a few decades.
The process is <unk> I suppose <unk> is the right word to name something that accelerates its own pace of change.
The more changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see that the process is <unk>
But I make my life designing computers, and I know that the mechanisms that we work for <unk> would not be possible without the history of history.
But now design objects of such complexity, that it would be impossible for me to make a conventional deal.
I don't know that every transistor on that machine machine.
There are billions.
Instead of that, with the designers of <unk> <unk> we think about a level of abstraction, we put it into the machine and the machine with that makes something that was before you didn't know, it gets much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes there are methods that we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method I've been using recently, is evolution itself.
We put inside the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the size of the microseconds.
And for example, at the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please computer, you can run a hundred million instructions to chance?
You could run these sequences, of instructions at random, running all those programs, and take those who are more attached to what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to order numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are most closer to order numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that a random random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them did it.
But one, luckily, he could find two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> could you take 10 percent of those random sequences that better <unk>
They put those and <unk> the rest.
And now we are going to get the best people to <unk> the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of <unk> analog to <unk>
Let's take two programs, that <unk> children, who <unk> <unk> and that the children will get the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of programs that had a little more success.
And we say, "Please repeat the <unk>
Let's go back again.
I took some mutations in it.
And it tries to try again and connect with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can make the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in complex cases in a few hours.
In the end, we ended up with programs that are going to be absolutely perfect.
In fact, they're a lot more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to analyze it to see how they work.
These are weird programs.
But do they meet <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the security of the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that did it.
In fact, their lives are dependent on this.
I was once in a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he takes a card and says, "Look at this.
He says, <unk> plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> working together to offer a <unk> <unk> doesn't make you feel <unk>
We know that the engineering processes don't work very well when they become complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to make very different design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering does.
We don't understand all the options that there are.
It goes in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster and so that we can run these programs much more quickly.
I mean, it was <unk>
The thing goes faster and faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
We're <unk>
And we're at a time analogous to the <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant of our thinking that we are the ultimate product of evolution.
And I think all of us are part of the creation of what is to come.
But now comes the lunch and I think I'm going to stop here before I was <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that needs to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent enough time enough to let me give part of my fake <unk> on that.
Before I treat my talk, let's talk a little bit about baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end, the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
The baseball is filled with amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's because of course, the <unk> talks about the statistics and use them to form a great baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope many of you know.
It's called average <unk>
And we talk about 300 percent of a <unk> that we were eating 300.
That means that the bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball into the game of play without being <unk> and that anybody who tries to go to the first base, not to get to time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three <unk>
You know how to call a <unk> from 300 in the Big <unk>
Well, it really good, maybe the team of stars.
You know how to call a baseball <unk>
By the way, that's someone that 10 car calls hit me.
<unk> like the legendary Ted Williams, the last player.
Now let's take this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable or maybe less awkward, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they're <unk> to a surgeon who has a record record of 400 in <unk>
So it doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that they live in a distant place and a dear self has two arteries <unk> <unk> and their family doctor is moved to a cardiologist whose record is <unk>
But you know what?
She's getting better at getting better.
And the hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I will ask you to ask you.
What do you think it should be the average of the hits of a heart surgeon, or a nurse <unk> or a nurse <unk>
Good.
And the truth of the issue is that nobody in all medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, from a doctor or <unk>
What we do, though, is sending them to the world, and I was included, with the <unk>
That never, ever made a mistake and try to figure out how to do it well.
That was the message that I was looking at when I was in medical school.
I was a bachelor's student. <unk>
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Sachs is studied until a blood test.
Just like that.
<unk> in my little <unk> <unk> residence at Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of memory.
From my course of the anatomy, <unk> the origin and the work muscle <unk> the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> the <unk> diagnosis and the standard.
And I even knew the differential diagnosis of how to classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more knowledge and more knowledge.
And I was really fine. I graduated with <unk>
And <unk> from the school school with the impression that if you were going to know everything, then you would know everything, or as possible close to everything, because this is what I'm going to get away from the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here in Toronto, and when they brought the lady back to the emergency service where I worked.
I was assigned to the service of <unk>
And when the emergency room is: I was going to go to a cardiologist to get me to this patient.
It will inform the chief of residents.
When I saw the lady <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when I read it, I heard a <unk> sound on both sides, which give me a heart failure.
In these conditions the heart is going to run and, instead of pump the blood forward, the blood goes into your lungs, these guys are filled with blood, and that's why there's difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did this and I went to work on the treatment that I read about it.
I gave him <unk> and medication to alleviate the pressure on his heart.
I gave him a <unk> of water pills so that it could remove liquid.
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt very well.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
Actually, I made two more mistakes.
He sent her home without talking to the chief of residents.
I didn't put the phone and did what I should have done, that I was calling my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss had seen it, he would have been able to give you the information <unk>
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a constant resident to get constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take <unk> that I could take care of my patients without even contact my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When I send it to his house, I didn't pay attention to a voice in my inside that said, <unk> is not a good idea. Don't do it."
In fact, I was so unsure that until I asked the nurse who was going to be asked by the <unk> "Do you believe it's okay if it goes to his <unk>
And the nurse thought, and then he said with total <unk> "Yes, I think I'm okay."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he signed up the high and ambulance next with the ambulance and carried them home.
And I went back to the hospital room.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach, I had a <unk>
But I kept on my job.
At the end of the day, I went back to leave the hospital and walked into the parking lot where my car was to go home. And I did something I don't normally do normally, at that point.
It went through the emergency emergency service to home.
And there was another nurse, not the one that <unk> from the lady <unk> before, but another one said to me three words -- those three words that most doctors emergency <unk>
Other specialists fear them too, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and it's that we see patients <unk>
The three words are: you remember this?
<unk> of the patient who sent her <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
"Well, she <unk> with the same tone of voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and on the edge of death.
By the time of an hour of having come to her home, after I gave him the high school, she suffered a collapse and his family called the <unk> the ambulance the ambulance brought to the emergency room with a <unk> blood pressure, which means a shock severe.
I was barely breathed and he was blue.
The emergency personnel <unk> all their resources.
They gave her medication to raise blood pressure.
And they put a artificial <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive therapy, and waiting for all of hope that he was <unk>
And in the two or three days it was obvious that we never will.
He had a permanent brain damage.
The family came together.
And in eight or nine days, they were going to get into what was going on.
And the ninth day, they let her go. Mrs. wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names of those who die.
That was my first experience.
The weeks ago, I was excited about it and experienced it for the first time the shame that exists in our medical culture and sat by alone, <unk> without feeling that healthy shame because you can't get it to your colleagues.
You make peace and you never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
<unk> shame I talk about is that makes us feel very wrong with it.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we're bad people.
And that felt feel.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family and I'm sure I would take the stuff out and made sure that I didn't get paid.
And I kept getting those questions.
Why didn't I ask my <unk> Why did he sent her home?
And my worst <unk> Why did I made a mistake so <unk>
Why did I choose medicine?
Little to that feeling was <unk>
And I began to feel better.
And in a <unk> day, it opened up the sky and finally came out, and I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I did a deal with myself in which if I would raise the efforts to be perfect for no more mistakes, I would do listen to those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
But it went back to happen.
Two years later, I was an <unk> in the emergency department, in a community hospital in Northern Toronto, and I got a man from 25 years with pain in the <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he used here.
I watched her throat, I was kind of <unk>
He would blow up penicillin and she sent him home.
But as he ran to the door, he was following his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to make my guard guard from the guard, my boss asked to talk to me <unk> in his office.
And he made the three words: <unk>
Remember the patient who saw for a pain in <unk>
Well, he came back and didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had a potentially deadly condition called <unk>
You can Google Google -- it's an infection, not from the throat, but it's going to be on the top, and it can cause the closing of those tracks.
him, fortunately, she didn't die.
You would get rid of antibiotics for <unk> and <unk> <unk>
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> and then I went back to work, until it happened again and again and again.
Two times in the same turn of the <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital -- because they were <unk> 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a calculation of <unk>
You know, an X-ray of kidneys, but it turned out a normal colleague who was checking the patient -- some sensitivity in the lower quadrant, and I called a surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
I read a liquid order for <unk> and I asked my colleague who <unk>
I checked it and notice some sensitivity in the lower quadrant, called the surgeon.
Both were <unk> and they recovered well.
But every case, I was going to love me.
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst errors in the first five years of exercise and as many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful have been over the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and <unk>
And here's the problem: If I can't tell you and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tell me what really happens, how to share this with my <unk>
How do you show this that they don't make the same <unk>
If I would go into a place like this, I wouldn't have any idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard somebody talking about failure, after failure, after failure.
Of course at a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you'll not hear someone talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well, as a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg, trust you would have a time to look at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system where there are two <unk> the ones that make mistakes and the ones that <unk> you can't sleep, and the ones that you know, the ones that have <unk> results and those who have great results.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction, like antibodies that start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you get from medicine to the people who make mistakes, you'll be a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years of diffusion and medical journalism, I've done a personal study of bad medical litigation and physical failures to learn how possible, from the first article I wrote for Toronto, "Star <unk> Black <unk> <unk> white, <unk> art.
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where errors happen every day, where one of the 10 drugs that are <unk> in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not correct. In a system where infection <unk> are more and more, causing chaos and death.
In this country, <unk> <unk> of medical <unk>
The U.S. Medical Institute established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And that's what things are.
A <unk> system where knowledge will be divided every two or three years, and we don't have to give us.
<unk> deprivation.
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow for a perfect history of a patient with pain on the chest.
Now, take the same patient with an chest pain on my chest, and it comes <unk> with <unk> eyes, and with breath to alcohol and suddenly my story was trying to contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things as well.
And my patients are not cars. They didn't deserve their symptoms always in the same way.
So all of this, errors are inevitable.
So if we take the system as we <unk> and we eliminate every professional prone to error, well, you won't be anyone.
And with respect to people don't want to talk about their most <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> white, art -- this is my worst <unk> I would say to everybody, from the ambulance to the head of surgery -- "This is my worst <unk> blah blah blah -- "What are your <unk> and <unk> the microphone into them.
And his students were <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and started telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
You can say, "Look, don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where they can do it.
They need a <unk> medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The medical doctor is human, they know human, they accept it, and it's not proud of their mistakes, but it tries to try to learn from what's happened to teach others.
They put their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
<unk> the mistakes of other people not with the intention of <unk> but in a loving way, and the support and the support for everybody to be saved.
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes rather than then.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I'm human, <unk> errors you.
And I feel a lot of it, but I strive for learning something that can communicate to others.
I don't know what to think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words -- I remember it.
Do you know how many decisions we take a day <unk>
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
I recently made a survey over 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that he says to pick a half a half a half a half a day.
Not long ago in a research followed for a week to a group of anonymous presidents group.
The researchers recorded the different <unk> tasks of these executives and the time that we need to make decisions related to those tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> <unk> jobs.
Naturally, every job included lots of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of their time.
Now think of your election.
Do you know how many belong to nine minutes, and how many of an hour?
How do they grade the way that they manipulate those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems today of <unk> choosing to <unk> choices.
I want to talk about the problem and about possible solutions.
As I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to meet your answers.
When I ask a question, like I'm blind, raise your hand just if you want to burn calories.
In other ways, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive please give you a <unk>
And now my first day on the day, are you ready to hear about the <unk> overload problem.
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at Stanford University, <unk> this <unk> supermarket at least in that time was very sophisticated.
He was called <unk>
It was almost like going to a <unk> park.
There were a lot of 250 different sorts of mustard and <unk> over 500 different kinds of fruits and vegetables and a little bit of water <unk> and this was when we made water <unk>
I loved going to that store, but I was asking myself, why never bought anything?
This is the oil shelf <unk>
They had over 75 different classes, including the ones that were in <unk> box that came from trees.
Once I decided to go to the manager and I asked him to do this strategy for offering all these <unk>
He pointed out to me with the buses of tourists which came every day, usually with his cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with <unk> This is the <unk>
<unk>
They had <unk> different classes.
<unk> a post for <unk> right to the store.
We put out of six <unk> or 24 <unk> or we looked at two things: First of all, what case people were willing to stop the <unk>
More people stopped when there were <unk> 60 percent, that when there were only six, 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a coffee <unk>
Here we find the opposite effect.
The ones that stopped when there were <unk> only three got to buy <unk>
When there was when I was six, we saw that 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, the people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were six.
Well, to decide that we don't buy any <unk> we probably buy it -- less is good to keep the <unk> but it turns out that the problem with choices overload affects us in very good decisions.
We decided to do not decide, even when this doesn't get us.
Now the issue of the day, financial savings now.
I'm going to describe a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we see decisions about savings for about a million Americans, from about 650 plans of this country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of money offers available in business plans for retirement, <unk> program <unk> people to save for the future.
And we found that there was really a <unk>
We had <unk> plans that were going from two to 59 different options.
We found that the bigger the number of funds, there were less participation.
So if we look at the extremes, we see that in the plans that they offer two funds, the rate of participation was 70 percent of the way they wanted to.
And in the plans that offer about 60 funds, the rate of participation dropped to the 1960s.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when you decide to participate, when there's more choices, even in that case, there are negative consequences.
So for those who decided to participate, the bigger it was the number of options, more people will be interested by avoiding actions or investment.
As much as more choices, they were more willing to invest in market financial accounts.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we are afraid to optimize social welfare for future.
In the previous decade we've seen three main negative consequences by providing more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is that <unk> the decision, even when it goes against self-interest.
It's more likely to take the worst decisions in finance and health care.
They are more likely to pick things less <unk> even though they want them better.
The main reason is that we need to look at that giant variety of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for comparison, contrast and choose from that amazing <unk>
Today I want to show you four simple techniques that we have <unk> in one way or another, in different research, so that you can use in your business.
The first is, <unk>
You've heard it before, but it's never been more true than today, which has never been more.
People are always bothered by when I say, <unk>
You care about losing space in <unk>
But actually what we're seeing is that if you choose to cut, get rid of their strange <unk> options, there will be an increase in sales, <unk> costs -- there will be a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> -- they saw <unk> increase in sales.
When the Golden Gate corporation did just eliminated the products for cats that are less <unk> <unk> increased <unk> <unk> for two <unk> more sales and less costs.
And you know that supermarkets, today, on average, give up 45,000 products.
In a Wal-Mart store there is about 100,000 products.
But the nine biggest shop in the world is <unk> and there is only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato tomato tomato tomato sauce.
In the financial savings world, I think one of the best examples that have emerged about how to handle the choices is the <unk> David <unk> the Harvard program.
All the Harvard employees are <unk> automatically to a life background.
Those who really want to choose, are offered to them, not 300 or more.
You know often people say, "I don't know how to <unk>
They're all options that are <unk>
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the differences that you have between those options.
And if your employees can't afford it either.
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was talking to <unk>
He told me that he would be willing to offer people in this audience a few holiday with all paid to the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to give you a applause if you're ready to take the supply of <unk>
<unk> applause) Okay. Anybody who is ready to accept the supply.
They're not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a little trick.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I really got to hear more hands.
All right.
In fact, you had more information on the first round, than in the second one, but I can tell you that they thought the second time was more real.
Because the images were making it really real.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the message of the message of the options.
For people to understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of each choice, and that the consequences should be feeling very highly <unk>
Why are people spending 15 to 30 percent more on average, when they use debit cards that when it uses <unk>
Because it doesn't seem like real money.
It turns out to be more real, it can be a very positive positive tool for people to make them more.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> staff who were working in <unk> these people were at a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
And to that meeting, which was in exactly how we were <unk> we made a little <unk>
What we added was that he would give the staff to think about the positive things that you would think about their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in the <unk> of 20 percent and an increase in the amount that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their <unk> accounts of <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than options.
For example, this is a study that we did in a hallway of magazines.
We saw that in supermarket <unk> throughout the corridor of <unk> the magazines can contain from <unk> different types to <unk>
But you know?
Because <unk> tells me how to <unk>
These are two exhibitions of <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
<unk> Let's have some of them.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> But you know what?
This <unk> framework is completely useless.
The categories must indicate something that we <unk> not when they were <unk>
You often see this problem with those big fundraising.
It's supposed to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can drive a lot more information than what we think of, if just <unk> a little bit.
We need to increase complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's see a very good decision by buying a car.
This is a German German manufacturer that allows us completely <unk>
You have to take 60 decisions to put the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of options that are offering each.
<unk> outside of the car. I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> box -- four options.
What I'm going to do is vary the order to make the decisions.
So half of the customers are going to go from many choices, 56 colors, at a few examples, four boxes.
The other half of the customers are going to go in a few options, four <unk> in 56 color, lots of options.
And what am I going to <unk>
What do you are.
If you <unk> the default button in every decision, this indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
We found that those who are going from many choices to few things, they would take the default button over and over again, and over again.
The <unk>
If you go from a few choices to many, they keep there.
Same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was alter the order of which information comes together.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Even though we choose the box of changes to say nothing about the preferences of interior decoration.
We are excited about a product that we're building now has more <unk> with the process.
So to sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to make it <unk> we can drive more categories.
All of these techniques that I've introduced you were designed to help manage the <unk> or better for you, to use them in your own business, or for people who are working on.
It's that I think the key to getting the best of a choice is being careful the <unk>
And the more so the more they are in our best choices we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the 1920s, East Germany, if you had a typewriter and you have to write it to the government.
And I had to record a sheet of text written with the machine.
And this so that the government could track the origin of the texts.
If they were writing with the wrong message you could trace the footprint down to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think that somebody could do this, how much that this is going to make the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser printer from any big manufacturer and prints up a page, that page is going to end up having some yellow dots on each page that follow a pattern that makes you own a pattern and your printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to be a lot about this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems on the network.
If you look at what's happening in the world online, we can put the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups.
They're the <unk>
As Mr. <unk> <unk> in Ukraine.
<unk> mobile phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use <unk> to earn a lot of money, huge amounts of them.
There are really many cases of the ones online online, allowing you to make money with your attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, <unk> <unk> etc., etc.
These guys do their online <unk> but they do it by illegal media by <unk> banking to steal money from our accounts when we buy in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we buy on a <unk> computer.
The secret to the United States, two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> you don't know your <unk>
And I say today it's more likely that any of us are being victim to be a victim of a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to be wrong with worse.
In the future, most crime are online <unk>
The second group of <unk> in importance that we see today is not driven by money.
There's another thing that moves, they motivate them to motivate them, the protests, they motivate them motivating them.
Groups like Anonymous have been <unk> in the last 12 months occupying an enormous role in the online attacks.
Those are the three main <unk> the criminals who do it for money, the <unk> like Anonymous who do it to protest and the last group are the United States governments that <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of attack, against their own citizens.
<unk> is an authority for the Netherlands -- or, actually, it was.
<unk> the break last fall because of a <unk>
They took the safety of the site and this <unk>
Last week, I asked a meeting with representative of the Dutch government representatives I asked one of the leaders if they said, <unk> the death of people because of the attack to <unk>
And the answer of him was yes.
So how do people die from a heart attack.
<unk> is an authority <unk>
<unk> <unk>
What are the <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services like <unk> services.
Except that they <unk> a foreign political authority.
And that <unk> <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt, the <unk> protesters based on the Egyptian secret police in April 2011, and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there was notes from a company based in Germany that had sold the Egyptian government tools for <unk> the communications in the country.
They had sold this tool for 280 euros to the Afghan government.
The company headquarters is right here.
I mean, Western governments provide the tools for governments to do that to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments are also doing this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, I found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by government officials to investigate their own citizens.
If you're suspicious of a criminal case, you know, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it's more there.
It is <unk> the Internet connection.
<unk> even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication, and listen to online arguments to get our data.
When we think about things like these things like these obvious response should be "Well, it looks like a bad thing, but it really doesn't affect me because I'm an honest citizen citizen.
Why do we <unk>
I have nothing to <unk>
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's in play.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a matter of privacy against safety.
It's about freedom versus control.
If we could rely on our governments today in 2011, whatever right that we're going to spend today, will be forever.
Let us just stop in any future government, in a administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that need us to worry about the next 50 years.
This is where I live. I live in Kenya, in the South National Park in Nairobi.
These are the cows of my dad, at the bottom, and behind the cows, National Park in Nairobi.
The National Park of Nairobi does not have most of the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate freely out of park.
And predators, like the lions, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of the people who killed at night, and so soon we got them in the morning and we found it dead -- I felt very bad because it was the only <unk> I had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came out of the sky with our animals and all the land to protect them, and so we value it so much.
So I grew up with the lions.
People were people who protect our community and the won, and they are also mad with the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think this is so few in the Yellowstone National Park.
A child in my community, in the age of six to nine years old, is responsible for the livestock of his father and this was the same as me to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought the lions were afraid of fear.
But I realized that actually this wasn't <unk> because I even helped the lions see the pen <unk>
I don't get confused by <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
I was trying to trick lions to they believed that I was near the <unk>
But lions are very intelligent.  They came the first day and they saw the <unk> and they were, but the second day, they came back and said, this thing is not moving, it's always here.  So she jumped and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day lions didn't come back.
I discovered that lions are afraid of the light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch on that to turn on and off the lights.
And this is a little lamp.
It's going to get everything.
As you can see, the solar cell load the battery and the battery -- the electricity to the small box, and I call it a transformational.
And the <unk> box makes the lights <unk>
As you can see, the <unk> give out outside, because that's where lions.
And this is how they see lions when they come from night.
The lights <unk> and <unk> the lions for you to think that I'm walking around the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never had a problem with lions.
And the neighborhood houses you heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed many animals the lions and asked me if I could put the lights up.
I said yes.
You can see them, you can see the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed it in seven houses in my community, and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also used for all Kenya, to freak out other predators as Lou <unk> and it's also using these elephant <unk>
Thanks to this invention, I was fortunate to get a grant in one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping to raise funds and <unk>
It even took my friends to my community and we set up lights in the houses that don't have, and I teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, it was just a kid in the meadows of the savanna <unk> the cows of my father, and he used to see flying planes and said that someday it would be within one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in plane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to get to be an engineer, and pilot when I grow up.
I used to hate lions, but now as my invention is saving the cows of my dad and the lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my tongue means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting it is to listen to a story like yours.
So you got a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on the other electrical detail.
What is the next to you <unk>
<unk> My next invention -- I want to make a little electric <unk> CA: One near <unk>
<unk> I know that the fences are already invented the electric <unk> but I want to make mine.
CA: So you <unk> it once, right? and <unk> <unk> I've tried it before, but I stopped because I got a <unk>  CA: At the foot of the canyon. Richard <unk> is a big thing.
We go to <unk> in every single step that I read my friend.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a small one, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "No <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we would move all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot from the rest of the world, except the Americas, South Korea, Japan are the enemies.
Although I was wondering about the rest of the world, I thought I would happen all of my life in North Korea, until everything suddenly changed.
When I was seven years, I saw my first public <unk>
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and I was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
That said, "When I <unk> this, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the two weeks long.
We're putting together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak that we're ready to die."
It was very altered.
It was the first time I heard people were suffering in my country.
At the time, when I was walking in front of the train, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
A life without life was dead in the street, holding a child <unk> in his arms watching her face without being able to do anything.
No one <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of themselves and their families.
A huge starvation on North Korea <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during famine and only few survived eating grass, insects and tree cortex.
They also became more and more prevalent the energy <unk> all around me was completely dark at night except by the lights in the sea in China, just crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite satellite picture in the night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> River, which serves between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans to cross <unk>
But many people die.
Sometimes, I saw bodies floating in the river.
I can't reveal the details of how I left North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of starvation was sent to China to live with family parents.
But I just thought I'd be separated from my family for the short time.
I could never have imagined that I would take 14 years to go back together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea how life is like refugee <unk>
But soon I learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but also dangerous, because the refugees North Koreans in China were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible fate in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare was actually done when I was arrested for the Chinese police and stood up at the police station.
Somebody had accused me for being <unk> then I would take my skills in the Chinese language and asked me a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to exploit.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and said the questions.
At the end of the <unk> a officer told another, "This was a fake report.
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans are looking for asylum <unk>
But many of them can be arrested by the Chinese policeman and <unk>
These women had a lot of luck.
Although there were <unk> had been eventually released after a harsh international pressure.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they're <unk> <unk> or executed in public.
Although I was lucky to escape many other North Koreans haven't had so much luck.
It's tragic that the North Koreans have to hide their identities and struggle so hard to survive.
Even after learning a new language and find work, all their world can be <unk> in a second.
That's why after 10 years of hide my identity, I've decided to add to South Korea going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much greater challenge than I had expected.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South America.
We are all <unk> but on the inside, we've come to be very different because of 67 years of <unk>
I even went through a identity.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country that I could call with a pride of mine.
Even though I went back to life in South Korea, it wasn't easy, I did a plan. I started to study for the exam to college.
Just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities took some money that sent my family, and, as guilt my family was going to be moved to the force to a location on the <unk>
They had to flee immediately.
I started planning on how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea, South Korea.
So ironically, I took a flight to China and went to the border with North Korea.
Since my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to take it in some way, for over 3,000 miles across China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and almost we were caught several times.
Once, our bus was arrested and talked about a Chinese police officer.
He asked all of them and started asking them questions.
As my family could not understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came to my family, <unk> I stood up and told him that they were people who were <unk>
I looked at me <unk> but fortunately I did.
We made it all the way to the <unk> border.
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the border guards in <unk>
But even after spending the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated for crossing the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was liberated in a month.
But in time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest points in my life.
I did all of us free my family, and we were so close to it, but my family was <unk> in prison at short distance from the embassy of South Korea.
I was going to come in between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to release my family.
But it didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man, "What is the problem?"
I was so surprised that a stranger would mind to ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary, he told him the situation, and without <unk> the man was the <unk> and he gave me the rest of the money for my family and to other two North Koreans and to take them out of prison.
I was going to marry my heart, and I asked him, "Why do I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he told me.
"I am helping the people <unk>
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
And the kind unknown was a new hope for me and for the people to go to the <unk> when we got it.
And I showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the <unk> people need it.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Korea.
But to achieve their freedom is only half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they went to a new country, they start with little or no money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practice practice practices of work, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people inside North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us continue in contact with family members, and we will send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've gotten a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans in the world, including on the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in Southern Center.
This is <unk> <unk> stores of fast food, <unk> land.
So the planners of the city came together and they thought, "We're going to change the name of South Center to represent something else, so they changed to Los Angeles and South Los Angeles as if this <unk> what's actually wrong in the city.
This is Los Angeles South   <unk> <unk> fast <unk>
Just like <unk> million other American Americans, I live in a <unk> desert -- Los <unk> <unk> home for food places to take and eat in the car.
What's curious is that the places of food to kill more people than food in the car.
People are starving.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times larger than say, <unk> <unk> which is like 15 miles away.
And I would notice that this will happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you go out of home see the <unk> effects that the current food system has in their <unk>
I see chairs from the wheels and sold like cars <unk>
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
The food is the problem and it's the solution.
I also got tired of driving 45 minutes back to buy an apple that has pesticides.
What I did, was planting a food forest in front of my house.
In a sliver of land we call a <unk>
It's about 45 feet three feet.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it.
I said, "Well, I can do what it comes to me in <unk> because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
So this was how I decided to do it.
So my group and I, L.A. <unk> we got together and we started planting our forest of food <unk> trees -- you know, the nine warm vegetables ...
What we do, we are a kind of a group of paid paid ahead of composed of all the <unk> of all the city and fully volunteer, and all we do is for free.
And the garden, it was beautiful.
Then somebody gets <unk>
The city looked at me and a summary gave me a <unk> saying that I had to remove my garden, the <unk> became <unk>
And I said, "Come on, right?
A court command by planting food in a piece of land that nobody <unk>  And so I was like, "Well, let's look at it.
Because this time wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had the story written by Steve <unk> and I talked to the <unk> and one of the Green <unk> members who put a petition on <unk> with 900 <unk> we were a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called me to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the city of America with more <unk> land.
It's got 68 miles of <unk> land.
That's about 20 Central <unk>
That's space enough to plant <unk> million <unk> plants.
Why the hell does it not look like this?
A plant will give a thousand seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> will give you 75 dollars of output.
It's my <unk> when I say to people, growing your own food.
<unk> your own food is like printing your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for Southern Center.
I grew up -- I grew up there.
I became a part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me for others, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I grew up my art.
As an artist of <unk> that <unk> walls, I <unk> soils, I would call soils, <unk>
I use the garden, the land, like a piece of canvas, and the plants and trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
You would notice what the Earth can do, if they stop their canvas.
You just can't imagine the amazing thing that is a <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I'm witness to how my garden became a tool of education, of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the ground.
We are the land.
You can see how to see the kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> act that you can do, especially in a <unk>
Also, they get <unk>
I remember a occasion, I remember a mother and her daughter, were like the <unk> of the night and were in my garden, I went out and looked at very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt bad to be there, and I told you, you know, you don't have to do this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame to see people who was so close to me with hungry, and this just reinforces why I do this, people ask me, <unk> don't temes people going to steal your <unk>
I say, "Oh no, I'm not afraid you're going to go to <unk>
That's why it's on the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to do it, but at the time, I want you to give you his <unk>
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a homeless shelter in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great, I shared their stories about how it had affected me and how they used to plant her mom and how they used to plant mom and her grandmother, and it was great to see how it changed, so it was just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had to have a few 50 people that come from, work and put all of them into a volunteer.
If kids are growing up, the kids will eat <unk>
If you grow <unk> they're going to eat <unk>  But if none of these things are told, if you don't teach them how food affects your mind and your body, eat blind what you put in front of them.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing that you're busy seeing guys of color that are on this path designed for them, which doesn't take them nowhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity where we can train these kids to get rid of their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe the next George Washington <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of the Earth, we never will.
Now this is one of my agenda, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant all of a block in gardens, where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take it up and turn them into coffee <unk>
I don't know me.
I'm not talking about free, because the free is not sustainable.
What's curious about sustainability is you have to <unk>
What I talk about is to put people to work to people, pull kids out of the street, who know the joy, the pride and the honor of cultivating their own food, opening markets from farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want you all to become a <unk> <unk> <unk>
We have to change the script of what is a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
That <unk> take your <unk> OK?
That is their weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to see me, I'm not calling me if you want to sit on the wrong chairs and have meetings to talk about making some shit.
If you want to see me, come into the garden with your <unk> so that we can plant something.
Peace Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  You probably all agree with me that this is a very good road.
It's made from <unk> and asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in days like today, which it rains too much.
You can have a huge amount of water in the asphalt that we have to <unk>
And especially if you go on on your bicycle and these cars go on that that's not very nice.
Also, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a loud material, and if we build roads, as in the Netherlands, we want a very close to the cities, we'd want a quiet road.
The solution to that is to make roads from asphalt roads.
The asphalt is a material that we use now in most of the roads of the Netherlands, has pores and the water can go through it, so all the water of rain flow down the sides and you'll have a road because it's easy to drive, and not <unk> water never more.
Noise is also gone.
Because it's very open, all the noise will go up, so it's a very quiet road.
It has <unk> of course, and the downside of this road is that you can be <unk>
What is <unk> looking at that side of the surface of the surface of the surface of the surface.
First of all, a stone, then many more and more and more, and so on, and you know, don't do that.  But you can harm your <unk> and you won't be happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create bumps with that.
<unk> Okay.
<unk> of course, you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
So here you can actually see how the damage comes into this material.
It's a asphalt asphalt as I said, so you just have a little bit of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the light <unk> to the <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> are <unk> and if they were <unk> they will become <unk> and separated from the <unk>
So if you drive down the road, you get the <unk> you see it here.
To solve this problem, we think of <unk> materials.
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use <unk> <unk> of that to clean up <unk> and we can cut the <unk> <unk> into tiny chunks, and we can mix these little bits with the <unk>
So we got asphalt with little bits of <unk> of steel on it.
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, you use a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat, especially steel is very good at that.
So what you have to do is heat the steel, melt the <unk> the <unk> flow by these <unk> and rocks go back to the surface.
Today I used a <unk> <unk> because I can't bring the great machine from <unk> here onstage.
The microwave oven is a similar system.
I put the show that I'm now going to take to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
We tested lots of samples there and then the government, they really saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We have to <unk>
So they gave us a piece of road, 400 meters of the <unk> highway, where we had to do a test lane to test this material.
So that was what we did there, you see where we were doing the road, and then of course, this road lasts several years without any harm. That's what we know about practice.
We take a lot of samples from this road and test them in the lab.
We made a lot of the samples, put a lot of burden on them, and then with our <unk> machine, and then we went back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can tell you that we've made a material using steel, incorporating these fibers, using <unk> energy to actually increase the lives of the surface of the road, they can even double the life of the surface. They will actually save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, you have curious if this also worked.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
In fact, you have to cool first before you can show you how it acts it.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11, I remember having aroused one morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening straight on his little gray radius.
He had a big smile in his face that was unusual at those times, because the news is generally <unk>
<unk> was <unk> she screamed my father.
I didn't know what to do, but I could see that my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a school of <unk> he said.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years when the Taliban were <unk> in Afghanistan and made that girls were to school.
For the next five years, I was going to love as a child to meet my older sister who could no longer be used outside to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that the two could be <unk>
Every day, we took a different route so that no one could suspect where it would be.
We had to hide the books in order to look like that we were shopping.
The school was in a house, over 100 of us stuffed in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in the summer.
We all knew that we <unk> our lives, the teacher, students and our parents.
Every time in a while, the school was suddenly <unk> for a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew about.
They were <unk>
Did you know where to <unk>
We were <unk> but still the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters were <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province in Afghanistan. Afghanistan, where his daughter, my mother, out to school, and so his father would <unk>
But my mother raised became a teacher.
This is it.
It took two years ago, only to turn our home to girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his family in getting education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a higher risk in not to educate her children.
During the years of the <unk> I remember there were moments when I was very frustrated with our life, and I was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. You can leave your house for a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we're going to do.
So you still want to be <unk>
Today I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women of my age have more than the school, and if my family had not been so engaged with my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I am here proud to graduate school at <unk> College.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, the one who was <unk> from her home to educate her daughters, was one of the first to <unk>
He didn't just get away from my college degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, I wear it on the streets in Kabul.
My family believed in me.
I dream big, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global ambassador of <unk> a global campaign to educate the women.
It's so <unk> <unk> the first and maybe the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country that is still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is that I see students in my school with the hard desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see their parents and their families who like the mine, <unk> for them, despite even though in front of a traumatic opposition.
As <unk> It's not his real name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter went out of her way from <unk> to her village, and literally escaped from being killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When I got to your house, they are the phone, a voice <unk> that if he kept sending her daughter to school, they would return to trying.
<unk> already, if <unk> said, "but we don't harm the future of my daughter for his old and <unk> ideas."
What I've been aware of Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of whom <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of his daughter and he sees the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key in our success.
In fact, often are the first compelling <unk> the very compelling future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who went to school are told in <unk> remember, it was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan is so different from here in the U.S.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
They would argue that these changes didn't last long after the retreat of American troops in the U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at students in my school and their parents who were <unk> for them, that <unk> I see a future <unk> and <unk> future.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities -- and every day the girls of <unk> I would tell me.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
Never forget the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> <unk> against him.
But you never get a <unk> <unk>
It has spent almost two years since the <unk> revolution, inspired by the surge of mass <unk> so much of the <unk> revolution as the <unk>
A forces with a lot of other citizens who are born inside and outside of the country to call one day of anger and initiate a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And <unk> was a great revolution.
Women and young men who were <unk> were at the edge, <unk> each of the regime, carrying freedom, dignity and social justice.
They've shown a <unk> <unk> with the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the East East, to the west, to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war, and a few losses from about 50,000 dead, we managed to release our country and overthrowing a <unk>
However, <unk> I left a heavy charge -- a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure of society.
<unk> out of the devastation and the challenges, I have loved a lot of other women, to rebuild civil society, to rebuild the civil society, <unk> a political and fair transition towards democracy and national reconciliation
There were about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the <unk> almost 300 in <unk>
After a period of <unk> years of exile, I went back to Libya and with a single enthusiasm -- I started organizing workshops about developing capabilities and leadership skills.
With an incredible group of women we started the <unk> of Women -- <unk> by <unk> -- a movement of women, leaders of a lot of women, to advocate for the autonomy of the woman and for our right of participation in the building of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the period -- an environment that was increasingly <unk> and more <unk> than the selfish policies of domination and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was successful and successful.
Women won a <unk> of the National Congress in the first choices in 52 years.
But shortly recently, the exhilaration of elections and the revolution as a whole, were <unk> every single day of violence.
One day we woke up with the news of the <unk> of ancient mosques and <unk> <unk>
Another day <unk> with the news of the murder of the American <unk> and the <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the murder of the military.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of the <unk> and their worship of human rights <unk> and the lack of the law of the law.
Our society, made up for a revolutionary mindset, it becomes more -- and it has been away from the ideals and principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, which we had at the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and revenge became the icons of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here today for <unk> with our story of success of <unk> and the election.
I'm here today to confess that we, as a nation we chose wrong, we make the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize well.
Because elections didn't bring peace and stability and security to Libya.
The list <unk> and the <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated with selfish policies of domination and <unk> both of men like women?
Maybe what was missing was not only women, but the female values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs national dialogue and the creation of consensus more than it needed for the election, which is just <unk> the polarization and the <unk>
Our nation needs the bacterial representation of the most likely to need the representation of it, and we used to do it.
We need to stop acting as agents of feeling and call it from anger.
We need to start acting as compassion agents and mercy.
We have to develop a female discourse that not just <unk> but also putting it into practical practice -- in practice, which is <unk> rather than the competition, the <unk> rather than <unk>
These are the ideals that an Libya, <unk> for war, needs desperately to reach the peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the interrelationship and the <unk> between female <unk> and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in such an existential way before you do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the same time, the word <unk> which is known in all of the <unk> traditions -- it has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> female and <unk> that unfolds all the humanity that men and women, from that all tribes and all the peoples have <unk>
And so as the uterus cover completely the <unk> that grows in, the divine matrix of compassion makes it all of us.
This is what he is like, "My <unk> all the things."
This is what he is like, "My <unk> <unk> about my <unk>
They will all be bothered by the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a beautiful question, which has an answer equally <unk>
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is the one that they all do -- why she's left?
Why was someone going to stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, or social worker, no arms in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
He was 22 years old, I had had been <unk> at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York City by my first job as a writer and editor in <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first green <unk> American <unk> and I had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I believed my alma mater, me gave me to my head with a <unk> <unk> with <unk> bullets to <unk>
The man, I loved more than anyone in this world, put a gun on my head and <unk> with <unk> more than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trap of love, where it fall every year of women, and even some men.
It could even be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm a <unk> in Harvard University and I have an MBA in <unk> of Business Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies on the list of <unk> <unk> between these Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington <unk>
I've been about 20 years married with my second husband and have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and I lead a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all races, all religions, all of the levels of income and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and domestic abuse, just happens in <unk> relationships and long duration or said otherwise, in the families, the last place where we want or we would expect to find <unk> because domestic abuse that domestic abuse is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that was going to be left with a man who sticks, and I was actually a very typical victim because of my age.
It was 22 years old, and in the United States women between 16 and 24 years old, they have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than other ages, and over 500 women and girls from that age are killed by partners, and husbands and husbands in the United States.
I was also a typical victim because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning signals or their patterns.
I met <unk> in a cold and rainy night of January.
I was sitting next to me in New York City and started to <unk> me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he was also <unk> from a college <unk> university and working in a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me about that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and that seemed like a single country.
He had some big <unk> like blocks, and a hair <unk> wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the most intelligent things that made <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the partner.
He did it mostly <unk> in a <unk>
We started out and I loved everything from <unk> which was so list that I had gone to Harvard, that I would put passion to help girls teenagers, and my work.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as no one had ever done it.
And it was why the bachelor's in that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much relevance to him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> the victim.
And I didn't know the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I was going to go from New York and to leave my dreams of my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your partner, so I would quit my job and <unk> and I went up with Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling into a <unk> <unk> who was getting into a physical trap in a physical trap and psychological trap <unk>
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts to.
And here is where those <unk> come in.
And as soon as we moved to New England -- you know, that site where you were supposed to <unk> I had to feel so safe he bought three <unk>
One was in the <unk> of the car.
Another one was stored under the pillow in our bed and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that he needed those <unk> because of the trauma that he lived in.
I needed them to feel safe.
But those guns actually were a message for me and, although I had never been lifted up my hand, my life already was serious danger, every minute of every day.
The first <unk> physical attack happened five days before our wedding.
They were seven in the morning and I still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, I put the girlfriend suit of my mother and married him.
In spite of what had happened, I was sure that we were living happy to all the time, because I loved it, and he also wanted a lot of a lot.
And I was very, very <unk>
It just had felt very <unk> for the wedding and the fact of forming a family with me.
It had been an isolated accident, and I never would have any harm.
I spent twice as much on our moon of honey.
And the first time I was driving into a secret beach and she <unk> me and he gave me so strong in my head that I <unk> several times against the <unk> of the car.
And then, a couple of days later, driving back on our moon of honey went into the traffic and threw up a Big Mac Mac to the face.
<unk> kept <unk> one or two times a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was excited when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One of three American women is a victim of domestic violence or bullying. At some time in their life, and the Centers for Disease Control report that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So actually, I had very good company.
To go back to my question: Why am I <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
On the contrary, I was a very strong woman, in love with a deeply <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world who could help <unk> tackle their <unk>
The other question that everybody does is: Why don't you just <unk>
Why not <unk> I could have been at any time.
For me, this is the saddest and painful question that people do, because we do our victims, we know something that normally you <unk> is incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
More than 70 percent of domestic violence cases occur after the victim has to end the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other implications include the permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has gone back to marriage, <unk> from financial judicial systems to the victim and their children, who normally are forced by the judges to spend time not to go with the man who would go to their mother.
And yet, we still ask why why it's simply not going?
I was able to be able to go, because of a last <unk> he was left to beat my denial.
I realized that the man who loved the man would have killed me if it was allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told everybody the world: the police, to my neighbors, to my friends and family, to complete unknown, and I'm here today because all of you will tell me.
We have the tendency to <unk> victims as headlines -- women -- women -- <unk> goods.
The question, "Why is it <unk>
For some people is a way to say <unk> is God <unk> as if the <unk> victims <unk> <unk> of men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also <unk> who learned a lesson from what happened to them, and that they <unk> their lives of joyful lives and happy as <unk> wives and mothers, completely free of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a victim and a survivor of domestic violence very typical domestic violence.
I went back to marry a cute man, and we have those three children.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to go back to you will never, ever be a soft gun pointing to my head in the hands of someone who says I will.
At this time, they're thinking, <unk> that is <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> but all this time I've been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to me right now, that they're being <unk> or they were <unk> or they were <unk> themselves.
<unk> could be affecting their daughter, his sister, to his best friend right now.
I was able to end my crazy love, particularly breaking the silence.
And I keep doing this today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
Noise abuse only in silence.
They have the power of ending with domestic violence simply shedding light on it.
The victims we need all the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
They put the abuse to the light by talking about it with their children, their friends, their friends and family.
It will take their vision of survivors as fantastic and fantastic people who have a future <unk>
You know, the <unk> signs of violence in order to go through a <unk> to stop its climb and show the victims a safe <unk>
And together we can turn our bed, our tables and our families in the <unk> safe, they should be.
Thank you.
Hello. I call myself Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be <unk> for 10 years.
And I feel that at this point, there's a uncomfortable tension in the room because I shouldn't have dressed them like this.  Luckily, I brought clothes to <unk>
This is the first part of clothing on a <unk> stage, so you have a lot of <unk> I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to be <unk> now, but I'll find out later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These galleries are very <unk> less bad than I don't have to use.
The worst part is going through this sweater through your head, because it's when you're going to laugh at me, so you don't do anything while you cover my head.
All right.
Why have I done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but it also <unk>
I have totally changed what they thought of me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and a photographer told me to go back to the back of the <unk>
Of course, except with surgery or an artificial tan like that I did two days for work, there are very little days that we can do to transform our looks, which, although shallow <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, to me, being brave means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model here.
Because I'm a nice, white woman, and in my labor sector, that's going to be a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how do you get a role model?
And I always say, a <unk> I discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made a model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of an <unk> and maybe you're wondering what is this <unk>
Well, in the last centuries we have not only defined the beauty as health, and youth and symmetry and symmetry, which we are biologically programmed to <unk> we've also associated with a high and <unk> shape and a white skin.
And that's my heritage <unk> I have known to take money.
And I know that there are people in the audience who are now showing up <unk> and maybe there are some <unk> who are <unk>
First of all, <unk> for knowing so much of models.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York told all of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- just <unk> -- I mean, less than four percent, they weren't white people.
The next question that people always ask me is: Can it be a model when it's <unk>
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't care about that.
But then, what I really would tell each of these girls is: Why? You can be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a surgeon <unk> ninja and poet, what would be awesome, as you were the first.
If after this lovely, spectacular list, but no, no, I want to be a model, then I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of nothing, and you could be the head of <unk> <unk> or the <unk> executive <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that you want to be a model of saying that you want to win the lottery when you are older.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job you can choose.
I'm going to show you all that I learned in 10 years as a model, because, unlike the <unk> surgery, can be summed up right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once your studies, you know, you know, your studies, and you have a copy and a couple of jobs on your back, no matter what you <unk> is to say, if you think you want to be president of the United States, but your resume would run Model inside for 10 years, people would look really weird.
The next question that people always do is if all the photos are <unk>
And yes, virtually all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that I was going on, and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my period.
I know we're entering the personal field, but it was a child.
And so I wore my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am in a <unk> party, a few days before the pictures for French <unk>
Here I am with my football team and in <unk> magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you realize I'm not in those photos.
They are <unk> from a professional group, <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all their <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and they get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always ask is this: <unk> for free?
I have too many inches from eight inches and ever use, except the couple of before, but the privileges I get are the ones I get in real life, and we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and once I went to a shop and I forgot to bring money, and they gave me the dress for free.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he jumped into a red light and, of course, <unk> and I'm sorry, agent in order to keep <unk>
<unk> of these privileges all of these privileges because I am. And there are people who are paying a price for their sense no matter who they are.
I live in New York, and last year, of the teenagers who were <unk> and 86 percent were black and <unk> and most of them were young men.
And there are only black and Latino young men in New York, so for them, it's not a matter of me <unk>
But how many times would you tell me, and I <unk>
When I research for this talk, I found out that at 53 percent of the <unk> girls in the United States don't like their body, and that figure comes up to 78 percent to the 17.
So, the last question that people ask me is: How is the life of a model?
And I think the answer that you expect is: If you're a little bit <unk> and you have the most brilliant hair, you'll feel so happy and beautiful.
And then behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe we can do it.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also amazing to be able to work with creative people, smart and passionate people.
And that's all right, but it's just one part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I've never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about every day.
And if you ever ask: With some more thin legs and the most brilliant hair will be <unk>
They just have to meet with a group of models, because they have the shortest legs -- the brightest hair and clothes more to fashion but probably are the <unk> women of the planet.
But especially it was hard to analyze a situation of racial oppression and gender of gender when I am one of the greatest <unk>
If there is something to retain this talk, I hope you all feel more comfortable to recognize the power of the image in perception that we have the success and the failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion for me to be older enough to attach a camera, but I want to share with you my 15 <unk> photos and I didn't go to the <unk>
There were no CEOs and no opportunity to repeat the pictures, not even a minimum <unk>
In fact, most they got tourists random.
My story starts when, <unk> in New York City to give a <unk> my wife dragged me this picture holding my daughter on his first birthday. That's the corner of 57 and five.
He just happened that we went back to New York City a year later, so we decided to get the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When my third birthday on my daughter, my wife told me, why don't you take me to New York on a <unk> journey, and you continue to <unk>
So here is when we started to ask the tourists to get the tourists to get the photo to us.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete stranger is so universal.
No one has never been denied and, fortunately, no one has been <unk> with the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became sacred to us.
This picture is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day in a way that a little girl was going to understand.
These pictures are much more than representations of a particular time or a specific journey.
It's also a way to stop time in a week in October and so we think about our time and our evolution over the years, and not just the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, while we always got the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter reaches new <unk> and I can see life through his eyes and how it feels and interact with everything.
That particular time that we spend together is something that we hope with illusion all year.
Recently, in one of the trips of travel, we were walking around, when a sudden he stopped in my tracks and pointed out a red <unk> of the silk store, which <unk> small visits in the previous <unk>
And he described to me what it was like to the five years of foot in that same place.
He said that he remembered their heart <unk> to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what looks in New York City are universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we created are the memories.
So, I want to share the idea of actively participating in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but besides these 15 pictures, I don't go out in many of the family pictures.
I'm always the one who gets the picture.
Today I want to encourage you all to appear in the picture, and I don't want to go close to somebody and ask him, and it takes a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are in the <unk> group.
First of all, why do they have so bad <unk>
It has also been associated with Disney laughs as silly as silly characters.
More recently, if you've been following the printing press, laughter, applause and <unk> these are the attributes that associate with Parliament <unk> but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because members of Parliament don't clean the environment clean --  <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.   There are two types of <unk> on this planet.
There are the <unk> in the New World City that are mostly in the <unk> like the <unk> and the <unk> of the World Trade where we have 16 species of these 16, 11 face that we have 11 risk of extinction.
So, why are you important? First of all, they provide vital ecological services.
It's our natural garbage <unk>
<unk> the cadavers to bone.
They help kill all bacteria. they help absorb anthrax -- that not to be caused by them, and they would cause big livestock to livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> people take from three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications in spread of disease.
<unk> have a huge historical importance.
They've been associated with ancient culture <unk>
<unk> was the symbol of the license and maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the United States and <unk>
In the mythology of <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the lion <unk> of the Tasmanian devil from 10 heads <unk>
In the <unk> culture, we are very important to open open sky -- in places like Tibet, -- there's no place to bury the dead or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural disposal system.
What's the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, of which six are at the extreme end of extinction.
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason they're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> <unk> communities use this venom against predators, and as a consequence, <unk> are victims of this.
In southern Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are at the critical <unk> of extinction, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years <unk> and the reason is because they fall prey of livestock consumption that has been treated with a drug <unk> like the <unk>
This drug has been banned from veterinary use in India and have taken a statement.
Since there is no <unk> there has been a spread in the number of <unk> dogs in <unk> and when you have dogs <unk> you have a huge bomb bomb, that <unk> number of rage has increased enormous in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind parks in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be above Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind energy, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to the birds. They cut them in half.
They're <unk> of birds.
In Western Africa, there is a horrible trade of <unk> dead to serve the <unk> and the <unk> market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're investigating these birds.
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel through different countries, so to focus on an urban problem is not going to do anything.
We have to work with governments at the <unk> level.
We're working with local communities.
We are talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these amazing creatures and services that we have.
How can you help? It can become assets, make noise.
When you go out of this room, you will tell you about <unk> but talk to their families, with their neighbors with their neighbors on the <unk>
They are very <unk> Charles Darwin said that changed by opinion because he saw it fly without effort, without energy spending in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much poorest without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything I do <unk> my life has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young people, but I am not.  I worked in Zambia. Kenya, Costa of <unk> <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for an NGO NGO and every project that we set in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
I took the 21, that Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, everything that we would expect.
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> of <unk> was a project where a few Italians decided to teach people from Zambia to growing food.
So we got to seed <unk> south of Zambia to this absolutely amazing valley that descends into the river <unk> and we teach the local <unk> tomatoes and Italians and <unk>
Of course, people were not at all interested in doing that -- so they gave them to come to work, and sometimes they were not allowed to come to work, we were amazed that the local <unk> in such fertile valley, were not in agriculture.
But instead of asking you how it was possible for you to be able to do nothing, we just said, "Thank God that we're here."
And of course, everything in Africa was grown <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a tomato tomato in Italy, and this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were telling the <unk> "Look how easy it is.
When the tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and red at night in the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared in the river and ate it.  And we said to the <unk> "Oh my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you say, "You're never <unk>
And I thought that only of the Americans, <unk> mistakes in Africa, but then, I saw what Americans, they did what the ones are, what the French did, and after seeing what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you can see, at least we feed the <unk>
So let's look at the <unk>  <unk> to see the waste that you give them to the <unk> people of Africa.
He wants to read a book, reading <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donors have delivered to the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about the damage that the money has been <unk>
They just read their book.
Part of an African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> missionaries and we treat people just two things: or <unk> or we're <unk>
The two words come from the Latin standard <unk> which means <unk>
But it means two different things.
<unk> I deal with any of a different culture as if they were my children, "I want you a lot."
<unk> I deal with all of the different culture of a different culture like my <unk>
So white in Africa are called <unk>
That book gave me a slap on the face -- "The little thing is <unk> written by <unk> who said for the economic development -- if people don't want to be <unk> <unk> alone.
This should be the first principle of help.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference put a cane on the ground and said, we can -- you can -- you can -- you can imagine a city that is not <unk>
I decided to just respond to the people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start anything, you never start anything, but it becomes a <unk> of the local passion, the <unk> of the local people who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what do you do? You <unk>
It would never come to a community with an idea, and they sit with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We got together at a cafe. We met in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we figure out what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give an idea to somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that that man has for their own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we helped them find knowledge because nobody in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but knowledge is available.
And so years ago, I had this idea: Why not we, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why not, for once, they would tell them -- but not in their community meetings.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community meetings.
The entrepreneurs never come back, and they will never tell them in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what opportunity have they identified.
So, planning has this point on the blind.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know it, because they don't go to their public meetings.
What do we do? We work at one, and we work face-to-face face you have to create social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You must create a new career.
The profession is the medical doctor of the company, the family doctor of the business -- which is set up with you in your house, on the kitchen table, and that helps him find the resources to transform her passion in a way of making a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of West Australia.
I was doing a Ph.D. in that time, trying to move away from this condescending junk that we got to tell you what to do.
In one year, I had 27 projects going on, and the government came to me to see the question, "How can you do that?
How do you do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very difficult.
And --   So --   So the government says, <unk> <unk>  We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We have helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the most brilliant business artists in history, passed away to '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before I engaged in business, and this is what Peter <unk> <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a <unk> economy.
<unk> is the kiss of death from the business of the world.
So now <unk> reconstructing <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come to talk with you.
You have to offer you no privacy, you have to be neat about the <unk> and then you're going to get in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What do you show you more like this morning.
People <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So, what I tell you is that the entrepreneurial spirit is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- <unk> fossils -- <unk> and one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of holding <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technology to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution, <unk> <unk>
The government?
It'll be the entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's a lovely story that it was in a daily magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to discuss the future of New York City in <unk>
And in the year he gathered together this group of people and <unk> about what would happen to the city of New York in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City would not exist within 100 years.
Why? Because they analyzed the curve and <unk> if the population is growing up to this <unk> to move the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses that would be impossible to address.
They were already <unk> <unk>  So in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that <unk> the life of New York.
So what happens? In the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States in the United States there were <unk> generic companies -- <unk>
And the idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few <unk> factories in <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer you <unk>
Otherwise, they're not going to come up with you.
Then, you have to offer you an absolute <unk> <unk> <unk>
And then later you will have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smaller company, the biggest company, it has to be able to do three things -- the product you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to tell with a fantastic marketing and you have to tell you with a great financial administration.
Guess what?
We've never met a single human being in the world that can be done, sell and look for the money itself.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not born.
We've looked at the 100 companies around the world, <unk> <unk> <unk> all new companies, Google, <unk>
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have in common, only one: No one was started by one person.
I never had the word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when he started.
No one begins one company. Nobody.
So, we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business environment <unk> in <unk> along with their dedicated comrades who will do for you, what somebody did for you, what somebody did for this gentleman is talking about this <unk> somebody who is asking you, what would it?
What can you do? You can do it?
All right, you can see it. You can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that."
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those around us can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't swap a lot of knowledge in spite of sharing the same public spaces.
Over the last few years I've tried to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> templates and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and ask more things without calling the door at a bad time?
How do you share more memories from our abandoned buildings and understand our <unk>
How do we share more our hopes for the empty stores so that our communities can reflect today our needs and <unk>
I live in New <unk> and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant birds that give shadow to <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
It always gives the music to the music.  The city has one show in New York --  The city has one of the most beautiful architectures in the world, but also one of the most beautiful <unk> properties.
I live close to this house and thought about how it could turn it into a smaller space for the neighborhood and also in something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost somebody who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother for <unk>
his death was sudden and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and a lot.
And this made me a profound gratitude for the life of life.
It gave it the clarity to the significant things of my life today.
But I would argue for keeping this look in my daily life.
It seems to me it's easy to be able to be able to be able to get on the day and forget the really important thing for you.
So with the help of old and new friends I transformed the wall of this abandoned house on a giant slate and painted about her phrases to <unk> Before she died <unk>
So, <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in the public space.
I didn't know what to wait about this experiment, but the next day the wall was filled with and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before they died, I want to be <unk>  Before they die I want to sit on the line of change in <unk>
Before they died, I want to sing for millions of people."
Before they died, I want to plant a <unk>
Before they died, I want to live outside the <unk>
Before they died, I want to make it more and more."
Before they died, I want to go to the rescue rescue.
Before they die I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and hopes of people made me laugh at <unk> and they gave me comfort in hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new and <unk> -- it's about giving you the reflection of the reflection and <unk> and remembering what is most important for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and I started getting hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues of the civic center, we made a kit and now have made walls in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
And together we show the power of our public spaces if we give ourselves the opportunity to express ourselves and share one another.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of distractions it's increasing, it's more important than ever, to find the ways to conserve the perspective and remember that life is short and fragile.
death is something that we often avoid talking about, or even think, but I understood that we are going to be for death is one of those things that will become more power.
If you think about death <unk> our life.
Our spaces shared can reflect better what we care about individuals and as a community and with more media to share longer, fears and stories, people around us can't only help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Today, I have a single request.
Please, don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my siblings.
<unk> is 22 and very hot.
Not speak, but it transmits joy than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
It's shared. <unk> happen what's going on.
It's not <unk> You don't see the color of the skin.
It doesn't matter to the religious differences and look at this: It's never <unk>
When singing songs of our childhood, trying to say words that I don't even think of -- it reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it must be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's very hot.
They took the <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but it reminds me of the year where each of the songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, getting pee in my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady birthday.
You don't think <unk>
But most people disagree with it.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the concept of normal, often they're <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, even though you would consider them inside it, that could only mean one thing: which were <unk> and <unk> and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes the physical skills.
In each individual it manifests itself differently, from there that <unk> is so different from Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, is being diagnosed with a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the developmental disorders that faster in the world, there is no cause no cure <unk>
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I was only three years old when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited about having a new person in my life.
When I spent a few months, I realized he was different.
It was a lot.
I didn't want to play as the other babies and in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
<unk> lived and <unk> in his own world, with his own rules, and I found pleasure in the smaller things, like putting the cars in row around the room, looking at the washing machine and eat anything that was <unk>
As I was growing up, it became more different, and the differences were made more evident.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the <unk> <unk> had something really <unk> a pure nature and innocent nature a kid who looked at the world without <unk> a human being that had never anticipated.
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, moments that I wish they were just like me.
But I look back at the things that have taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I realize that they're things that would not want to change the normal.
<unk> happens to the high beauty that give us the differences, and the fact of being different doesn't mean that some is wrong.
It just means that there's a different view of what is right.
If I could take a single thing to <unk> and Sam and you know, it would be that you don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because autistic or no, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> Each of us has a gift on its inner and, honestly, the search for normal is the last sacrifice of the potential.
The opportunity for the <unk> the progress and the change dies at the time where we try to be like others.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit what must have been <unk> in the country of <unk>
Penn State asked me to me, a teacher of communications, which was a kind of communication to students of engineering.
I was scared.  And I was scared. <unk> of these students with his great minds, his big books and his big and his big and unknown words.
But when those conversations, I felt what it was, must have sense when she fell through the <unk> hole and saw the door of a new world.
So I felt like I had those conversations with the students, I was surprised by the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a great communication.
We desperately need a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our biggest challenges -- from energy to the environment and care of health care, and if we don't know how to understand this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as not scientists to have these interactions.
But these big conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please, <unk> <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure you can see that your science is sexy and your engineering is attractive.
First question to ask you, and then what?
<unk> why is science relevant to us.
Don't tell us just that you study the <unk> you are looking at the <unk> but you study the <unk> that are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat <unk>
And when you're describing your science, <unk> with <unk>
<unk> is a obstacle to our understanding of your ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why don't I say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> <unk> is not the same as <unk>
Instead, as Einstein said, which everything is as easy as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate clearly their science without engaging the ideas.
One thing to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies -- they are ways to hook up with their content.
And when you present his work, forget about the signs of <unk>
Have you been asked by what they're called <unk>  What do the <unk> <unk> die, and <unk> their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not just boring, but it's going to be <unk> too much in the language of our brain and <unk>
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that it really inspired the unique design of the <unk> <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple phrase <unk> that the audience can understand if you lose a little bit, and then you can make graphs that we bring to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what they <unk>
I think these are just some key ones that can help others open the door and look at the country of the wonders that is science and engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation, by all the media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all the Oxford English <unk> is <unk>
Just because it sounds very good.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was an <unk> editor of the 19th century that the defined defined a lot better when he said, "A <unk> is that he looks for a public charge of <unk> platform or principle, and that, when he won, he gets it through the mere use of a monumental <unk>
I have no idea what it means.
Something to do with words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know that they have to try to dominate the language.
It was not <unk> for example, <unk> that British Parliament allowed newspapers to quote the exact words they were said in the <unk> chamber.
And all of this was because of the bravery of a guy with the very unusual name of <unk> <unk> who was confronted by the <unk>
He was thrown in the London Tower and he <unk> but he had enough courage to deal with them, and at the end he had such a popular support in London to won.
And just a few years later, we had the first recorded use of the phrase <unk> <unk> so <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most people think it's <unk>
It's not. It's for an advocate of freedom of expression.
But to actually show you how words and politics interact, I want you back to the U.S., just after independence.
So, they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, its leader.
Didn't you know.
How do you call a <unk>
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They were introduced all sorts of suggestions that might have <unk>
Some wanted to call it <unk> of State <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the <unk> of the American <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some of them just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was about tested quality.
And not even with that they were <unk> they had the idea that you could be chosen for King for a given shot.
And there could be <unk>
Everybody got tired of <unk> because this debate was happening for three weeks.
I read the newspaper of a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and the <unk> was that the House of Representatives was against the <unk>
The House of Representatives did not want to have Washington <unk> of power.
They didn't want to call it King for if I was like, or she would give him to her or old ideas.
So they wanted to give the title more <unk> more <unk> and more unfortunate <unk>
And that title was <unk>
President. They didn't invent the title. There was only before, but it was just meant <unk> that I would have a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were <unk> presidents of little <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it was really a <unk> title.
And that's why the Senate will spread.
They said, "is ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who will take a serious title with a <unk> and <unk> like President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the U.S. Senate didn't survive.
We can learn three things about all this.
First of all, and this is my favorite one until I have been able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk> as the title of President.
President Barack Obama has kind of standing there, waiting for the Senate to action.
The second thing we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> possible that we keep waiting for <unk> years.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and this is what I want to tell you about is that the American President of the United States doesn't sound at all as modest today, right?
And especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear heads to note, the largest economy in the world and a fleet of flying vehicles and so on.
The reality and the story has endowed with <unk>
So in the end, I won the <unk>
They got their title of <unk>
And also the other concern of the Senate, appearance it -- well, it was a <unk> then.
But you know how many nations they have now <unk>
And everything because they want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 nuclear heads and so on.
Then, at the end, the Senate won and the House of Representatives -- because no one is going to feel humble when you tell them that they're now President of <unk>
And I think that's the big lesson that we can learn, and that I would like to give you to <unk>
politicians are trying to choose and use words to shape and control the reality, but actually changes much more of the words that what they could change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to meters under the land in a illegal mine.
The air is heavy from heat and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of body bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that talk about, but above all, that cacophony of <unk> <unk> and stones and stones with primitive tools.
Like others, I carry a cheap flashlight of light, he supports his head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely tell the <unk> branches that hold the walls of that hole that falls down hundreds of meters on the ground.
And my hand and I suddenly remember a <unk> that I met days before, who lost control and dropped countless feet on that well.
As I talk to you today, these guys are at the deep time of that hole at their risk of their lives without paying or threaten and, often, dying.
I went out of that hole, and I went home, but they might never be will, because they are prey for slavery.
In the last 28 years I was documenting native cultures in more than 70 countries on six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the <unk>
Among all the amazing people I met there met an <unk> <unk> the <unk> a NGO who has been thinking about modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and, really, I started learning about slavery because I knew there was there in the world but not to <unk>
When we end up talking to me, I was really excited about to ignore this <unk> of our days, and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
It made me <unk> <unk> and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these places.
Some of the even considered my second home.
But this time, <unk> <unk> dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there are over 27 million people in the world today.
It's twice as much as the number of African Africans in all about the slaves <unk>
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of about 50,000 people today.
However, you can be enslaving entire families to entire families for generations per <unk> equivalent <unk>
Amazingly, slavery generates more than <unk> billion dollars a year around the world.
Many of you have been <unk> with false promises of good education and better work to find that they are forced to work without pays under threat of violence and can't escape.
Today, slavery operates in the <unk> the goods produced by slaves have value, but the people who are produced are disposable them.
<unk> exists in almost everybody in the world and yet it's illegal throughout the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the bricks.
This strange and formidable show was like entering the old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
I would go on on a temperature of 54 degrees men, men, women, in fact, families -- entire families -- <unk> <unk> bricks in their heads, to 18 at the time, to 18 at the time, and take them from <unk> <unk> to trucks that are at hundreds of feet.
<unk> by <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task, and again for 16 -- 17 hours a day.
There was no coffee to eat, not to drink, and the severe <unk> made it <unk>
So <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera was turned too hot to the face and stop working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean the team and make it work with air conditioning to be <unk> and sitting there, I was thinking, my camera gets a much better treatment than these people.
Back on the <unk> I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was on my side quickly grabbed me and said, "You know, I don't know. Don't do it here."
And it explained to me very clearly to demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I couldn't offer you any direct help.
I couldn't give them money, anything.
I was not a citizen of that country.
I could put them in a situation worse than they already were.
I had to trust <unk> the <unk> and working inside the system by his liberation and he trusted him to <unk>
In terms of me, I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas, I found kids <unk> stones for miles per mile miles up to trucks who were waiting down.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than the kids who charge and children put them into their heads with wine <unk> made of <unk> ropes and <unk>
It's hard to witness something so <unk>
How can we influence something that <unk> but so <unk>
Some of you don't even know that the slaves -- and they work 16 -- 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been this whole life.
You have nothing to <unk>
When these villagers <unk> his freedom, the <unk> had completely <unk>
When you hear the word slavery we often think about sexual trafficking, and because of this global consciousness, I warned you that it would be hard for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously previously <unk>
I gave me a little bit of a steps that gave this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was rather a restaurant.
<unk> as you know in the craft, they are local for prostitution to <unk>
They have small rooms -- private, where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of these only seven years -- are forced to entertain customers and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Every place is dark and <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse of their clients.
On the <unk> I remember a sense of <unk> <unk> and in that instant, I could barely imagine what should be stuck in that hell.
I just had a <unk> the stairs for where you get going.
There was no <unk>
There were no windows big enough to <unk>
These people don't have <unk> and, because you touch a very difficult subject, it's important to point out that slavery -- even sexual trafficking, it happens around us.
There are hundreds of people <unk> in agriculture, <unk> in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 children are sold every year as sex slaves every year.
It is everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often associate with the labor of <unk>
I went to Indian villages where there were entire families in the silk trade.
This is a family portrait.
The black hands of black are the father, <unk> of blue and red, of their children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> the silk on the liquid to the <unk> but the <unk> is <unk>
My translator told me their stories.
"We have no <unk> they said.
You still hope, however, you can go out of this house someday and go to another place where you really pay our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 children <unk> in Lake <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we arrived, I went through a quick look.
And I saw what seemed to be a fishermen of fishermen on a boat, two old brothers -- some young children -- a few younger kids, and it makes sense, right?
<unk> They were the slaves.
Children are separated from their families and <unk> and forced them to work with large <unk> in these boats in the lake, despite not knowing swimming.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came up to it was <unk> I mean, her little canoe was <unk>
He was paralyzed by the fear of falling water.
<unk> branches of trees plunged into Lake <unk> often trap networks and children, <unk> and fear, it's thrown into the water to unlock the branches.
Many of them are <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work on the lake.
In fear of his love he's not going to flee and, like all life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> tries to be younger slaves under his charge.
I met these guys at five o'clock in the morning, when he <unk> the last networks, but they had been working on one of the time.
On the cold night and <unk>
And it fits to point out that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village in fishermen.
I met him in a refuge where we <unk> the <unk> victims of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes is possible.
Who will get to be because someone decided to make a difference in their life?
<unk> by a road in Ghana with <unk> <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> and he suddenly accelerated and <unk> our car and played the window.
They asked us to take it out of a land way to the jungle.
At the end of the way, we got to get out of the car, and he asked the driver to come up very quickly.
And then you signal this path barely visible and said, "This is the path, this is the road.
As we started to go off, we removed the <unk> that <unk> the way and after walking close to an hour we found that the road was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the pictures of the photos on my head as it <unk> in these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> I ended up <unk> in one of course, and we had a mass of holes that could fit into a soccer field, and they all were full of <unk> workers.
Many women had children tied up on their backs, and while they were looking for gold, they would go with <unk>
<unk> is used in the <unk> process.
These miners are <unk> in a well.
When they came out of the pump they were <unk> in their own sweat.
I remember looked at his eyes tired, <unk> because many had been under land for 72 hours.
<unk> have to 90 feet and these people carry heavy bags of stone that will then be transported to another area where they <unk> the gold.
To the first view, the site seems to be full of strong men and <unk> but if we look close to the margin we see to work at least less fortunate, and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> ends like this victim of T.B. and <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died, he took him to work with him in the mines.
By dying his uncle, <unk> I did inherit the debt of the uncle that force it to be a slave in the mines.
When I met her, she had worked on mines 14 years and the injury of the leg that you see here is a product of an accident in the <unk> so serious that the doctors said that it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and yet it is forced to work on night and day in that mine.
Yet, he dream of being liberated and educated with aid activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, of face to a remote possibility -- which inspires me a lot of respect.
I want to shine light on slavery.
Did you know that your images would be seen by you all over the world.
I wanted you to know that we're going to help us witness it to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see each other as human beings, then it's very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not from magazines. They're people, real people like you, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect for their lives.
There is no day that I don't think about these so many beautiful people, <unk> I've had the great honor to meet.
I hope that these images bring a force in who you see, in people like you, and I hope that that force will turn out a fire and that fire <unk> light on slavery -- because without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do applied mathematics and there's a particular problem for whom the <unk> are like management designers.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So I'm going to try to explain to you what I do.
<unk> is one of the most human activities.
We get rid of the ballet <unk> and the dancers.
But the ballet demand is a degree of extraordinary training, a high level of dexterity and probably a <unk> initial <unk> that can have a genetic component.
Unfortunately, neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease -- gradually this extraordinary skill as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, at his time, was a virtuous ballet ballet ballet dance.
In the last few years, it's a lot of progress on the treatment.
However, there are <unk> millions of people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a weakness <unk> <unk> stiffness and other symptoms of this disease, so we need tools to use to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way and ultimately the only way we will know if there is actually a cure to be when we have an objective measure and <unk>
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement has no biological <unk> so they don't use your blood analysis, and the best thing we have is a neurological exam for 20 minutes.
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that, outside of the clinical trials, they never do.
What if patients could do it at home?
That would save a trip to the clinic. What if the patients could get their test ourselves?
You wouldn't need personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to think about as a very conventional form of a <unk> you see, in a certain sense at least we are all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of string <unk>
It shows somebody healthy while it emits sounds at the talk, we can imagine as dancers of a vocal presence, because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sound, and we all have the genes for an example.
And as they did it, they need an extraordinary level of training.
Let's think about time that leads to a child to learn to speak.
From sound, we can track the position of vocal chords as they <unk> and like Parkinson's affects the <unk> it also affects the <unk> organs.
In the bottom line you can see a <unk> example of <unk> <unk>
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> weakness and <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice with the clinical trials that we have <unk> Well, both of them are <unk>
<unk> is not <unk> they both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do it.
And both of them are accurate. Well, but also <unk> examinations are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, take about 30 seconds as a lot.
They are minimal cost, and we all know what happens.
When something takes a cost so <unk> it appears to mass scale.
These are some amazing goals to address.
We can reduce our patients.
You wouldn't have to go to the clinic for the <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> we could get goals.
We could make a massive mass of low cost for clinical trials for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> on a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it's too late.
So by giving the first steps in that sense, we're launching the Women's <unk> Initiative.
Along with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start addressing these goals.
We have <unk> local lines for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with or Parkinson's or <unk> can call it low and put recordings for about cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've already reached six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So let me take all of these samples of, say 10,000 people, you'll be able to say who's healthy and who doesn't?
What will you take from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, what happens is that during the call you have to indicate whether or not the disease isn't TR: Sure.
<unk> You see, some people may not have it. You may not get it.
But we're going to get a very large sample of data in different circumstances, and to do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking for <unk> the confusion of confusion for the actual markers of the disease.
TR: Do you have an precision precision at this point?
A lot more than that.
In fact, my graduate student, I have to <unk> it has done fantastic work and now has shown that it works on the mobile phone network too, which is going to take the project. We now have a 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk>
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March of 2011, I made <unk> <unk> in New York City.
Are we creatures.
We get into the dark, in <unk> rooms and large, we avoid sunlight.
We make thin models even more <unk> the perfect skin is still doing the impossible -- we do the impossible -- we can do it in the press all the time, but some of us are actually artists with talent with a lot of years of experience and a real taste of images and photography.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, as well as the rest of the world, the events that happened in Japan.
And shortly after, an organization where I was voluntary -- <unk> <unk> was in the place working as part of the response team.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew that we couldn't stay in home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
The 13 of May traveled to <unk>
It's a little fishermen of fishermen located in the <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first people affected by the wave.
The recorded level of water has reached over 24 feet tall and over three kilometers from the ground inside.
As you can imagine, the people were <unk>
<unk> out of the channels and the <unk>
<unk> schools, we took the mud and leave it ready to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons and tons of fish and tons of fish in the local factory <unk>
We <unk> and loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers like the neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and photos and cameras and cards and cards.
Everyone did the same thing.
<unk> and bring them to different places of villages around them.
It wasn't until I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of personal losses that people had <unk>
While they were fleeing the wave, and to save their lives, they had to abandon absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a <unk> center.
It helped clean the stall, gigantic <unk>
This place turned out to be also the place in the village where the <unk> center -- the photos.
And I had the honor of that day, and I had the honor of that day to wipe out the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, I had heard the expression to think beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until far beyond my horizons.
By looking at the pictures, I found some of a hundred years in the lab, I was still in the lab, I couldn't help to think about how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I walked into Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
I wasn't too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl had to do it with a lot of precision and <unk>
In other ways, that little girl would not have what she looks like, and that would be as tragic as having the photo <unk>
At the time of time, they got very lucky enough photos and needed more <unk> this is that I entered Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people were offered to help.
In two weeks I had 150 people <unk> <unk>
In Japan, in July, we <unk> <unk> a village in the north of <unk>
Once a week we use our scanner in the <unk> libraries that were <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
And the time that <unk> in <unk> is a different story, depended upon of the <unk> of the photos.
It could fit an hour an hour. I could have a couple of weeks.
It could be <unk>
This <unk> had to draw pretty much for hand using the areas that color and detail that the water was not destroyed.
It took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these pictures of water, saltwater, covered of bacteria, with algae even oil, with the time of time, I continue to <unk> that was a major part of the project.
We couldn't afford the picture unless I was clean and dry and had been <unk> by his <unk>
We were lucky with <unk>
We have a guide to a <unk> <unk>
It's very easy to harm the pictures even more <unk>
As once he said -- the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures was lucky to the photos.
He had begun to <unk> her same but stopped to realize that the <unk> even more.
I also had <unk>
Without them, the images of their husband and his own face was not supposed to be <unk> we were able to put the images into a single photo and put it out the whole picture.
When I picked their photos shared something from his history with us.
A few colleagues in his husband found the photos on a fire station between the rubble of the rubble that he used to be his house, but his colleagues would find it.
The day of the tsunami, his husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water as the <unk> <unk>
His little children, not so small now, but their two kids were at school, in different schools.
One of them was trapped in the water.
He took a week to find her family and know that everybody had survived.
The day I gave him his pictures his youngest son was 14 years old.
For her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift I could <unk> something that he could come back to you, something that he could remember from the past that was not labeled on that day of March when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined there, <unk> hundreds of them helped us to clean hand for more <unk> photographs, the great <unk> -- the vast majority came to the hands of their own <unk>
Over 500 volunteers around the world helped us bring back to 90 families hundreds of <unk> photos and <unk>
During this time, we don't really spend more than <unk> 1,000 in teams and materials, most of them in ink for <unk>
We take pictures all the time.
A picture is a memory of somebody or something, one place, a relationship, somebody wanted.
They are <unk> from our memories and stories, the last thing that we would give us, but the first thing they would look for.
And this was the project, to restore small pieces of humanity, to bring back to someone with the past, with the past.
When a picture of this comes back to someone, it makes a huge difference in the life of the person that you get in.
This project also made a big difference in life of <unk>
Some of them connected to something bigger -- to bring something bigger -- using their talent to something that are not active models of perfect skin.
To finish this email I would like to read this email that I was sent from Japan after six months.
As I <unk> I couldn't stop thinking about people and the stories shown in the images.
One in particular, a photo with women in different ages from the grandmother to the young child, gathering around a baby, <unk> me because a similar picture of my family my grandmother, my grandmother, my mother, me and my daughter <unk> he hangs out of our wall.
In the whole world, in all the few of our basic needs are the same. Right?
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> inspired us to wonder and curiosity with this picture of a bullet going through an apple on one of just a billionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go to a million times faster and see the world not a million times a billion or a billion frames per second.
I give you a new kind of <unk> the <unk> a new technique that can create videos in slow motion of light in motion.
And with that, we can create cameras that can see after <unk> beyond the vision, or see the interior of the body without using X-rays, and really challenging the camera.
If I take a laser pointer and I switch on and put it into a second of a second or so, in a number of <unk> to create a photo of photons just a millimeter long.
And that package of photons, that <unk> travel at the speed of light, and, again, a million times faster than a common bullet is going to do.
If we take that bullet and this <unk> pack in this bottle, how do you spread out those photons inside this <unk>
What is the aspect of light in <unk> camera.
Now, all of this --  -- remember, all this is happening in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so that you can see the light in motion.
So Coca-Cola is not <unk> this research --  <unk> a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> enters the bottle with a <unk> package that starts to <unk> and that, inside, it starts to <unk>
Part of the light is <unk> it goes to the table, and we started seeing these <unk>
Many of the photons finally come to the cap and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's an air bubble that bounces off inside the inside.
At that time, waves travel down the table and because of the insights at the top of the top you see in the bottle, after a number of boxes, the insights will be <unk>
Now, if we take a regular bullet and current and we make it go down the same distance and we see it in slow motion to about 10 billion times, how much you think it would take us to see that film?
One day? A week? Actually, a whole year.
It would be a very boring movie --  of a slow bullet in motion.
And what do you do with nature <unk>
You can see the waves from the table of tomato and the wall of the bottom.
It's like throwing a rock on a pond.
It's the way nature looks like a picture, I thought about a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a composition of view.
But if you look at more and more <unk> you'll notice that, as the light gets rid of the tomato <unk> they are still bright. They don't get away.
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the light goes down inside its inside and it goes back after several <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your cell phone, they will be able to go to the supermarket and check whether fruit is grown without having to <unk>
What do we create this camera at MIT? at MIT?
As photographers, you know, if you take a picture at low exposure, it comes very little light.
But we're going to go a billion times faster than the <unk> <unk> so I just get some light.
We sent that <unk> that package of photons, millions of times, and we recorded over and over again with a very <unk> <unk> we took those data <unk> and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data into crude and really interesting.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible, themselves.
And if a new power of a <unk> future would allow him to look at the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw something from light on the door, and you go into the room, a part is going to reflect on the gate, and from there to the camera.
We could extract those multiple light <unk>
It's not science fiction. We already built.
On the left is our <unk>
Behind the wall there's a dummy and <unk> light on the door.
After our article in our article in Nature <unk>
And a tiny fraction of the photons will go back to the camera but interestingly, slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works like this, this is how fast, we have unique capabilities to it.
It has very good time resolution, and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances to the door and also all the hidden objects in the door, but we don't know what point there is a distance.
When you project a laser -- you can record a picture in a neuroscientist, that you see on the screen, it doesn't really have any sense.
But we're going to take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, and we will try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the secret object.
Can you see it <unk>
This is our reconstruction.
We have things to explore before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that are <unk> with what's going around the curve, around.
Or we could find survivors in dangerous conditions, looking at light reflected by the open windows.
Or we could build <unk> able to see the interior of the body through <unk> and the same for the <unk>
But of course, because of the tissue and the blood is quite hard, so this is actually a request to scientists so that they start thinking about <unk> as a new visualization sector to solve the problems of mammography in the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> himself himself a scientist, made science in art, an art of photographs <unk>
I realized that all the <unk> of data that we collected is not just for scientific visualizations but we can do it.
It will create a new form of computer photography with slow motion and color code.
And look at those ripples on the time between each of those waves -- is just a <unk> of a second.
But here also happens something fun.
If you look at the waves under the <unk> you get away from us.
The waves should be moving towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange effects, Einstein would have loved this image.
The order of which events occur in the world is sometimes <unk>
<unk> the corresponding warping of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone, your life, and gives you an individual freedom.
With a mobile phone, a crime against humanity in Syria.
With mobile phone, you can tweet a <unk> and start a protest in Egypt.
With a mobile phone you can record a song, you will breathe to you and get famous.
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and live in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment, to this city.
Here you can see the hundreds of thousands of people who are looking for a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people gathering that <unk> for change, had a cell phone in our pocket.
Who here are a mobile phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phones, <unk>
<unk> A Blackberry, wow!
It's a lot of a lot of people today have a mobile phone.
But today I'm talking today about my mobile, and how it changed my life.
I'll talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> of information.
<unk> data.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006 the E.U. Commission presented a <unk>
The <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This board says that every European company, every single service provider from the entire Europe, has to store a wide range of information from users.
Who calls <unk> Who sends an email to <unk>
Who sends a text to <unk>
And if we use your mobile, where we are.
All of this information is stored for at least six months, and to two years, in their phone company or your Internet <unk>
And all over Europe people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the phone to be the <unk> and the Internet providers, we have all this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, they all said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about ten thousand people who came out to the streets of Berlin and said, <unk> not <unk>
And some of them even said this would be <unk> 2.0.
The <unk> was the secret policeman of East Africa.
And I also wondered if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use your <unk>
So I asked my phone -- <unk> <unk> who at that time was the largest telephone company in Germany, which is for me to give me all the information that they had on me.
I asked them once, and I went back to ask them, and I didn't get a concrete answer. It was all the <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to take a demand demand because I wanted this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we won't give you this information.
At the end of it, he agreed.
And they would send me the demand and they send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the <unk> Veterans' Court failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly <unk> in brown with a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty and five thousand miles -- 30 information lines.
I watched them and I said, well, it's a huge archive OK.
But after a time I realized that it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I go at night, what am I doing.
But then I said, I want this information to happen.
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the retention of data.
So, along with <unk> <unk> and Open It City, we did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and pull out, go back and forward.
You can see every step I do.
And you can see how I go from <unk> to <unk> and how often I call the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That gives a little scary.
But it's not just about me.
It's about all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me a couple of times.
Then they call me some friends and they call each other.
And then one calls the other, and the other one to the other, and we ended up with this big network of communications.
You can see how their people communicate each other to what time they call each other, what time you sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society is.
If you have access to this information, you can control their society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who speaks to whom, who you send him an email to whom, all this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said to the beginning, imagine if all of these people in the streets of Berlin, in the fall of 1989, had a mobile phone in your pocket.
And the <unk> would have known who I was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> would have known who were the leaders, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall may never have happened.
And as a result, not the fall of <unk>
Because in fact, the state agencies and companies want to store as much information from us as possible within and out of the web.
They want to have the ability to follow our lives and they want to <unk> forever.
But <unk> and living in the digital age, is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for the <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When you go back home to your friends that privacy is a 21st century value and it's not very <unk>
When you go home, you go to your representative representative because companies and state agencies can store some information, you don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what you store from you.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones to show you that you have to fight for the <unk> in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hello TEDWomen, what happens?
Not enough.
Hello TEDWomen, what happens?
I call myself <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor that brought me to the world.
I took my mom six times in six different directions, <unk> to the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have brain palsy, and that's why they <unk> all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
<unk> C. It's not genetics.
It's not <unk> it can't <unk>
No one <unk> the uterus of my mom and not <unk> because my parents were cousins, but they are.
It's just by accidents, like the one that happened at birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not a source of inspiration -- and I don't want any one of us in the room in this one.
It feels bad for me, because at some point in life, you wish to be disabled.
Let's go for a ride.
Christmas television is at the mall, you drive in the mall, you drive a lot of parking lot and what do you see?
16 empty empty places.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit of <unk>
In addition, I tell you, I have 99 problems, and it's, C. is just one of them.
There was a gold <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I'm a <unk> Muslim -- woman, disabled and live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe you should do it.
I'm from Park <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved that my neighborhood and my illness had the same initial age.
I love that if I want to walk from my home to New York, I can do it.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, not <unk> but my parents don't believe in the owner of it.
The mantra of my father was, "Can you <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three big sisters would be <unk>
If my three sisters were going to public school, my parents would go to the school system and get <unk> from the school system and <unk> that I would also get out there, and if we didn't take all the ultimate note -- they had the <unk> of my mother.
My father taught me to walk at the age of five to the age of five and just walking.
Another tactic I used to do was to hang a dollar in front of me so that he would get it.
The <unk> that I carry inside was really strong, and ...
Yeah. The first day in the kindergarten was walking like a boxer <unk> champion who has received a lot of <unk>
Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city and they were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arabic, and they keep all of the family.  I think nobody realized we were not <unk>
This was before 9/11, and that politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to the <unk> as opposed to campaign.
The people I grew up had no problems with my faith.
However, it seemed to be a lot of <unk> a lot of starvation on the <unk>
I told you that it had enough fat to live three months to live three without eating three months without eating -- so let's stop at dawn at sunset is very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yeah, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford the physical therapy, so they sent me to dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or whatever I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and we want to be <unk> so if my friends were using <unk> I was too.
And when my friends were going to spend the summer vacation on the coast of Jersey, I was not going.
I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid that if we don't go back to Palestine all the <unk> we would get into <unk>
On summer vacation I was often trying to <unk> so I was drinking milk from <unk> so I got drinking milk out on the back, I was going to get back into the <unk> Sea, and I remember the water <unk> and I was like, <unk> <unk>
But the cure cure was yoga.
I have to say it's very boring, but before you do yoga it was a <unk> comedian that I couldn't stand up with <unk> <unk>
And now I can put it on the head.
My parents <unk> this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at the <unk> Hospital.
I went to college by <unk> and I got a grant for the University of the State of Arizona, because I would go in all the <unk>
It was like the pet department of the theater.
All of me.
I did all the tasks of the least intelligent, I took the ultimate note in my classroom, and also in his classes.
Every time I did a scene from the crystal of glass my professors <unk>
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called <unk> very slow in Jackson.
It's a piece of a girl with cerebral <unk>
I was a girl with cerebral <unk>
So I started screaming at the four <unk> <unk> <unk> will have a <unk>
I have <unk> <unk>
By the end of the end of the end of it? At the end of it.
Thank God <unk> I am <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave it to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running to the head of the theater department, crying historically, as if somebody had killed my cat, ask me why and she told me that because they thought I could not make any risk stunts
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the stories of risk, you can't do the <unk>
It was a role for the one that literally had been born and gave it to an actress without a brain.
The university was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> story of <unk> actors without disability for disabled designers.
And I went back home, and my first tour tour, was as extra in a <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew that it would be <unk> from <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, I stayed there as a <unk> I didn't see it more than the <unk> and it was obvious to me that directors of <unk> actors are not white, without white, with disability.
Just let perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: They were <unk>
So I made it <unk>
And on my first tour, he tour, he came up comic book from New York to New Jersey, and I'll never forget the face of the first comedian that took when he realized that he was going to high speed on the New Jersey with a driver that had cerebral <unk>
I worked in clubs across the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, without <unk> and <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know you never heard that little sound that says that women are not fun, and they find us very fun.
In 2003, my mother of another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> <unk> Festival in New York, now on his 10 year.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in media and to remind us to remind the directors that <unk> and Arabic is not <unk>
<unk> Arabs were much easier to fight against the challenge of stigma disorder.
My great opportunity was in 2010.
I was like invited to the news program by the cable <unk> by Keith <unk>
I walked back as if I was at a graduate dance, I was going to join a study and sat down in a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and said, <unk> you can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I cling to the desk to not get out of the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
I finally had my opportunity and <unk> I knew I would not go back to me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but I was like <unk> full-time and pasted my chair.
Something fun I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It's said that kids are <unk> but they never fall away from me and no girl as well.
All of a sudden, my disability on the Internet became <unk>
<unk> video clips with comments like, "Why are you <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite example: <unk> <unk> terrorist.
What does it have?
We should really pray for her."
A reviewer suggested even to add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is so visual as the race.
If somebody in the wheelchair can't make <unk> then you can't make someone in a wheelchair.
<unk> are the <unk> Yes, man.
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors said that not <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
However, I have grown up with the media, I don't think they <unk>
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in media and in everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, that would be less hate on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we even need the whole society to teach our children.
My <unk> journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I got to <unk> by the red carpet <unk> by the <unk> Susan <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk>
I got to act on a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the world <unk> <unk> have become <unk>
I was <unk> in representation of the great state of New Jersey in the <unk> 2008.
And I started "The Children of <unk> a charity to give the children refugees.
It was the only time my father saw me live alive, and I devote this talk to his memory.
<unk> in peace, <unk>
I call myself <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a kid in a small village.
I don't know his name, but I know your story.
She lives in a small town to the South <unk>
This village is near <unk>
<unk> drives the small village to poverty and on the edge of the <unk>
Without anything for him there, it's going to the big city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there is no opportunity, no job, no <unk>
He's just living in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year <unk> nothing.
One day he was about a man who offers to take it to <unk> after dinner, to <unk>
He knows a dynamic group of people, which gives a break.
He gets a little money to buy new clothes, money to send home to her family.
They present to a young lady.
I finally house.
A new life.
It has a goal of life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky, bursts a bomb.
That boy of that little village with dreams of the great city was the terrorist bomber and that dynamic group of people were to <unk> a connected organization with the Qaeda.
So how did the story of a kid in a small village trying to fulfill their dreams in the city end with him <unk>
He was waiting for him.
I was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start his future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing he arrived.
This was the first thing that he got out of what we call "the <unk> period.
And their story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young urban <unk> that <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, who are looking for something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For the kids, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the chance, for work, anyway, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often youth who suffers from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of five people living in cities are under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if they don't tell them -- the story of the <unk> of <unk> the door of access to terror, to violence, to <unk> being the story of 2.0 cities.
And in my hometown of birth, we <unk> 70 percent of the young men are <unk>
Seventy percent don't work, it's not going to school.
They do practically nothing.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the hospital hospital where I was born.
I remember standing in front of that hospital <unk> thinking, and if I never had he gone?
And if I'd seen me forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
It would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure I'm the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to support some juvenile leaders at a corporate Amazon.
<unk> to about 90 juvenile leaders.
We sat down and we had a rain of ideas about the solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He went to the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no job, no opportunities.
And I remember when he said to me, because it was a graduate student, <unk> frustrated, was the perfect white for Al <unk> and other organizations in terrorists, to be <unk>
They were looking for people like him.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to get from point A to B is the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have been completely destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
He started a <unk> company.
He started <unk> motorbikes to local residents who normally couldn't afford them.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some point <unk> to hundreds of motorcycles over the next three years.
Why is it different this story?
What does this story do?
I think your ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit, and I believe that entrepreneurial spirit can be the most powerful tool against <unk> in <unk>
So let's bring young people to being the creators of economic opportunities that are searching so desperately for.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the summit of corporate enterprise and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen over 22 years, and until recently, until Mohamed came, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were about plastic from <unk>
If you ask someone, "When was the last time you saw <unk> flowers.
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer is, <unk>
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company of <unk> and <unk> design.
He created a farm on the outskirts of <unk> and he started to grow <unk> and <unk> who said, could they survive the hard climate <unk>
And it began the delivery of flowers for marriages, creating gardens in the houses, and the city companies -- and now it's working on the creation of the first public park in <unk> in 22 years.
There are no public parks in <unk>
He wants to create a space where young families, young people, can go together, and as he says, smell the pink <unk>
By the way, he's not growing pink because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO, working for the government, but their history, their innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
It forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
I encouraged them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that could be <unk> of change.
For the end of the day, they had innovative solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
We inspected business solutions for local problems.
So, we inspire young people and create a culture of entrepreneurial spirit -- it's really a great step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need experience and guidance for <unk> in development and set out of their business.
<unk> the young people with the resources they need, <unk> the support that they need to move from conception to creation, and they will create an <unk> for urban growth.
For me, the spirit spirit is something else to start a business.
It's creating a social impact.
Mohamed aren't just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Its Peace Park, this is how it calls it when it's created, transform the way people see their city.
<unk> I hired children on the street to help rent and maintain the motorcycles for him.
He gave them the opportunity to escape from the <unk> of <unk> <unk>
These young people who are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is that my suggestion is to become young in the entrepreneurs, <unk> and eating their innovation <unk> and they will have more stories about flowers and Parks than <unk> and <unk> of <unk>
Thank you.
I was about ten years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the mountains -- <unk> a <unk> area north of the state of New York.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest <unk>
The sun was going to make the leaves <unk> as a <unk> and not the way that we were <unk> we could almost pretend we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a <unk> in a <unk> with a beautiful <unk> lake when I discovered something nasty.
Behind the <unk> there was a <unk> of about four square feet with apple hearts -- aluminum <unk> balls and <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy to get what they thought was going to clean their <unk>
That question followed by me, and it was <unk> a little bit.
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how it <unk> or where you will, the <unk> who cleans our trash in <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or Paris or <unk>
Here in New York, the Department of <unk> cleans our garbage, which is 11 tons of waste and two billion tons of <unk> every day.
I wanted to meet them as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What do you feel to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and I walked through her pathways, and I interviewed people in office and facilities across the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed to get more.
So I began to work like garbage <unk>
Now I'm not just traveling in the trucks. I <unk>
And he operated the mechanical vessels and <unk> the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and amazing learning.
They all ask about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as widespread as you think, and in the days in which it is very strong you will become quickly.
It costs a lot of getting used to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years and their bodies kept <unk> the weight of taking over their body tons of garbage every day.
It's also the danger.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics <unk> the waste collection is one of the most dangerous <unk> in the country, and I learned why.
You're coming out and traffic entering the traffic all day and go around around you.
You just want to <unk> so the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the <unk>
And also the crap itself is full of dangers that often fall out of the truck and cause terrible harm damage.
I also learned about the relentless trash.
When you go out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that garbage is like a force of nature itself.
It never leaves coming.
It's also like a way of breathing or circulation.
It must always be in motion.
And it's the stigma.
I think stigma is particularly ironic because I believe that the <unk> of waste are the most important workforce in the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They are the first protective <unk>
If you don't get rid of the waste in a efficient and effective way every day, this starts to <unk> from their containers and their dangers inherent in very real forms.
We have been controlled for decades and centuries and centuries and they start to <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old thing, we don't have room for what the motors of the economy begin to fail when it's endangered the consumption of the economy.
I'm not advocating by capitalism, just by pointing the relationship.
And then there is what I call our average speed we need.
And with that, I mean, just at the speed of which we used used to move in the contemporary time.
We usually don't get <unk> and we got to put it up with us our coffee cup -- our stock bag our water bottle.
We use them -- the <unk> we forget about them, because we know there's a job force on the other side that you take to it.
So I want to suggest to you a couple of ways to think about the waste collection that maybe help reduce stigma and leverage them in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
Her work, I think, is almost <unk>
They are on the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when they were going to go?
And their work allows us to do our own.
It's almost a way of relief.
The flow that keep us away from ourselves, from our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow must always stay in one way or another.
On one day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a waste collection on the street, I took my son small and I went down the stairs running the stairs and there was a man doing his journey of recycled paper as he did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank her work that particular day, but I started crying.
And he looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be okay.
We're going to be okay."
Shortly after that I started to investigate the waste collection and I went back to the man.
It's called <unk> we work together many times and made us good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
We're going to be fine.
But in our efforts by <unk> the way we exist on this planet as we as a species we have to include and to account at all the costs, even the very real human cost of the labor of labor.
The municipal waste we think about when we talk about garbage, they represent three percent of the amount of waste from the nation.
It's a remarkable statistic here.
So in the flow of your day and their lives, the next thing you see to someone whose work is to clean the crap of you, <unk> a moment for <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you thank you.
My work is focused on the connection of thinking about our community life forming part of the environment where architecture is naturally born of conditions and local traditions.
Now I brought two recent projects today as an example of this.
Both projects are located in the emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the end of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a mall for several stories in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa,
This is the kind of construction that they showed us as an example, my team and me, about what we needed to design.
At the beginning, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go to <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very big stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to use a lot of energy because the <unk> can generate heat into the interior, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city where this shouldn't happen, because it's a temperate climate that goes from 20 to 25 degrees throughout the year.
And third, his appearance has nothing to do with Africa and the Ethiopia.
It's a very rich place for a culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really enchanted by the old market that is this structure in the open air where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to little <unk>
There is also that idea to use public space to generate foreign activity.
So I thought, that's what I really wanted to design, not a mall.
But the question was how to build a modern <unk> of several stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to <unk> the site, which is located in a far area of the city, where much of the buildings that we now see in the image, not even exist.
And it's also between two parallel streets that they don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, joining all the inputs of the building.
And this spreads out to an <unk> <unk> that creates a space in the <unk> building in the building that goes into their own way, the sun and rain.
And around this space we've applied the market idea with small businesses, which changes on every floor because of the space form.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that we would react to local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a tissue like a concrete <unk> with <unk> to allow the air to air and also the light, but in a <unk> way.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons in the dresses in the <unk>
They have the properties of fractal geometry, and that helped me shape the <unk>
We're building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows that leave the air and light in a form controlled inside the building.
This is <unk> with these little colors of colors that use the light inside the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas it didn't get easy to convince the developers because they thought, "That's not a mall. It was not what you do.
But ultimately, we all realized that this idea of the market was going to be much more profitable than the mall because in order to accounts there were more local to sell.
And then the idea of the facade was much more economic -- not only because of the material in comparison to the glass, but also because it wasn't necessary to have air <unk>
So we get certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
And the first thing was to think about how to achieve the energy <unk> for the building in a city where electricity is cut almost every day.
So we get a big advantage to putting on the roof.
And then under those panels we think of the roof as a new public space with areas of the meeting and bars that would create this <unk>
And these <unk> on the roof, which in conjunction collect water for <unk>
It's expected for the beginning of the next year, because we go through the fifth floor floor.
The second example is a master of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to make a project that is so big, the bigger that I have had, I needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also its environment, his tradition and culture.
During that analysis I put special attention in <unk> a structure of 1,000 years old that he was surrounded by a wall with twelve doors of access to almost straight lines.
When I went to the place, the first design operation that we did was to expand the streets and creating 12 similar blocks in size and characteristics that there are in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some strategic points in relation to the idea of the doors with straight lines, and this altered the initial model.
And the last operation was to think about the cell, the little cell in the project as the apartment, as the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the <unk> climate.
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore natural ventilation.
So we would have a framework that claims most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the low plant we have all the connections to pedestrians.
And it also responds to local norms that set up a higher density of higher levels and a lower density in the ground plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space in the project is almost as giving back to the community that is occupied by construction.
It's where all the neighbors, they can go up and <unk> and make activities such as running a body of two miles in the morning, or jump from one building to another.
These two examples, have a common approach in the design process.
And also, they're in the emerging countries, where you can see cities literally grow.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in life of people changes local communities and local economies at the same rate that the buildings.
So for this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but we need to improve the relationship between the community and the environment, and they have as a target to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl entered our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
I had big amounts of very bright hair, and a little <unk> <unk> <unk> was super strong for state capitals very good for <unk>
And I ended up that year, and I was full of jealousy, until I <unk> my sinister plan.
One day I was given a time after the coming out of school, I was a little late and I hid in the house of girls.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I went into the classroom, I took off my master's book, <unk>
And then, I did.
It was <unk> in my <unk> just a little bit, just a few these.
All the Like I --  And I set up to bring back the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my other classmates, had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put all of the rows of <unk> and myself a row out of it, just because I was there, because I was going to be there.
I'm still surprised what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came from.
I don't understand why I was good at doing it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never got to me.
It was all obvious <unk>
I will never tell me.
But most of all, I was struck by the reason why I would be bothered by this little little little girl to be so small, it was so good for me.
I hate jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
Also, the primates. The tiles are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of spouses in the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study that we had the loneliness, or the long duration or sadness.
So you have to go to the fiction, because novels are like the lab that you study the <unk> in all of its possible forms.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there was no argument that there would be no literature.
Well, I wouldn't have <unk> the <unk> wouldn't have <unk>
There would be no king <unk> no <unk> and a <unk>
There would be no Shakespeare.
I read the reading lists of high school school, because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> would not have <unk> and <unk> -- <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Without cyber, there is no <unk> I know that <unk> has the answers for everything, and as soon as it does have all of them.
This year, you spend 100 years of their masterpiece, "In search of the <unk> the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also the ordinary <unk> my God, everything we might have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details -- right?
We think in a child trying to reconcile the dream.
We think about a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forget how hard that is that image.
We forgot how relentless it is.
I mean, it's about books that Virginia <unk> said were as hard as <unk>
I don't know how the cat, <unk> but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go as well together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious to be very obvious that the connections that are reduced to person, their desire, their <unk> are a very good narrative <unk>
I don't know. I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel jealousy, we tell ourselves a story.
One story about other people, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
And to be in the same time as storytellers and audience, we know exactly what the details are going to do to <unk> the <unk> right?
<unk> make us all novelists <unk> and that's something that <unk> understand.
Everything that she does to give me pleasure could give pleasure pleasure to another, maybe right now."
And it starts saying to himself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every fresh charm that <unk> detects in his lover -- adds it to his collection of instruments of torture in his private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, the <unk> <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break out of it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's a tough job. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an emotion <unk> You have to <unk>
And how are the <unk>
<unk> are <unk> from information.
<unk> use the details.
At <unk> they like the great amounts of bright hair, and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> came out of the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  <unk> links very good language <unk> with jealousy.
When <unk> is in his lifelong agony of soon listening to the doors and <unk> the <unk> of his lover -- then the behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different than the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "These scientific research has true <unk> value.
<unk> is trying to prove that <unk> see <unk> and they make us seem <unk> but in their <unk> they are seeking knowledge, search for the truth, a really painful truth, in fact, what we would make -- <unk> the more painful the truth better.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> These were the <unk> <unk>
He says, "A woman who we need to, that makes us suffer, to cause us to make a lot of much deeper feelings and vital feelings that a wise man can help us.
It's telling us that we go to look for women.
No, I think it's trying to say that the <unk> will reveal us ourselves.
And there's some other emotion that makes us <unk> in this particular way.
There's some other emotion to us, we were <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion that teaches us to look at the intensity that teaches us.
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a very <unk> young man who was being consumed with the idea that his wife would <unk>
And Freud said that there was something weird about that man, who didn't get into what his wife's wife.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that were doing his wife, without realizing <unk> behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or even accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud said that the man was becoming the <unk> of your wife.
<unk> are really good at this.
<unk> just described very well how the <unk> make us look at it with intensity but accurately.
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, we are the more we become <unk>
And for this reason, I think, <unk> lead us to make violent acts of violent acts.
<unk> are driving us to behave in totally <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about me at the age of eight years old -- but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard on the news.
A woman from Michigan years old was captured by having created a fake account on Facebook since they sent awful messages to itself, for a year.
For one year, a whole year.
She was trying to <unk> the new girlfriend of his former boyfriend, I have to confess that when I was or this, I reacted with <unk>
Because, let's be realistic.
How big -- even though we say, creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a Patricia <unk> novel.
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of American literature.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books that are trying to make our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of the souls, the membrane that separates what it might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or wanting what you have to be <unk> and you're going to take away from what you ever <unk> and it's under the floor -- you know, it takes your rings, cow accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route from Tom <unk>
I can't give you <unk> everyone as much as I wanted to.
It's a pity, because we live at the time of envy.
We live in times of jealousy.
I mean, we are good citizens of social media, where the coin is <unk> right?
<unk> show us the <unk> I'm not safe.
So we're going to do what the characters are always doing when they're not sure, when they're looking at a mystery.
Let's go to <unk> <unk> Street and asking for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think about Professor <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always had <unk> <unk> <unk> the head <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> that needs <unk> <unk> needs the <unk> genius, but it bothers him.
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs their help, but they would take it to <unk> and <unk> in each of those puzzles.
But as working together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of the Six <unk> once <unk> <unk> <unk> to all his solution, <unk> <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he tells you that there is no person in <unk> <unk> that I wouldn't want to raise your hand.
It's one of the few times that we see <unk> was in history. I find this very emotional -- that scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems like to treat <unk> as a problem of geometry, without emotion.
You know, in a minute <unk> it's the opposite side of <unk>
At the next minute, they're the same side.
Suddenly, they are allowed to admire that idea of being the <unk>
Could it be so simple?
What if <unk> are really an issue of geometry, just a question of which we allow us to be in relation to the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to <unk> the excellence of the other.
We can relate to it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So as we hope that happens, we remember that we have the fiction for <unk>
Only fiction is <unk> jealousy.
<unk> used to <unk> you invites them to the table.
And look at what the sweet <unk> of Tom <unk> the crazy <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21, 2009, Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the <unk> <unk> of Apollo 11 and landed on the Sargasso Sea.
Armstrong and he went up with themselves, but his presence in gray <unk> it was the culmination of a collective process.
And the Apollo program was the biggest continued in peace in American history.
To get to the <unk> NASA spent about 180 billion dollars of day or four billion dollars of the federal budget.
Apollo gave a few 400,000 people and asked about 400,000 people and asked the collaboration of 20,000 companies, universities and agencies.
<unk> people died, including the crew crew crew <unk>
But before the Apollo program <unk> 24 men traveled to the moon.
He walked over his surface, which was going on after the Armstrong died, the past year, is now the most <unk>
So why would we care?
They didn't have a lot of <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that the 24 <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The killer answer is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to show the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the words of Kennedy at Rice University in <unk> give us a better idea.
John F.
Why do it turn it into our goal?
And you might ask, why can we scale the most <unk> mountain.
35 years ago, why do you fly over the <unk>
Why does Rice Rice <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We choose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're difficult.
Jason <unk> for the <unk> of Apollo was not just a victory of the West on the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was the <unk> of the powers of technology.
It was because it was great to be able to do it.
The landing on the moon happened in a context of a long list of technological Things."
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the airplane, and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, they <unk> the <unk> and we eliminated smallpox.
Technology appeared to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970, called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a boat with candle -- but in 1969, the Apollo crew of Apollo 10 flew to 40,000 miles an hour.
Since 1970, no human being has gone to the moon.
Nobody has been faster than the crew of Apollo 10, and the joyful optimism about the power of <unk> <unk> and the joyful optimism about the power of technology has been <unk> when we can go to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, or feeding the world population seem to have a result of <unk>
I remember seeing the <unk> <unk> 17.
I was five years old, and my mother told me that I didn't belong to the escape escape from the rocket rocket <unk>
I knew that this would be the last <unk> mission, but I was totally sure that I would come to see the colonies on Mars.
So that's what it happened to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We hear it all the time.
We've heard it during the last two days here, at TED.
It seems like the technologists would have <unk> and they were enriched with horrible toys, things like <unk> apps and social media, or algorithms that speed up the sale <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've expanded and enriched our lives.
But we don't have the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's a <unk> explanation in Silicon Valley, that <unk> that have been created less ambitious than <unk> in the years that they were <unk> whether I'm Microsoft, and Apple and Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says markets are the guilty, in particular, the incentives that venture capitalists offer entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk of risk caused us to create <unk> ideas for the funding of problems or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
It was mostly going wrong with <unk> Valley.
Even when the risk capitalists were at their high point without worrying about the risk of risk, small investment than they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had trouble to invest with the benefit of technology as energy, that they need a huge capital and whose development is long-term capital and development has never invested in the development of technology intended to solve big problems because they don't have any commercial value.
No, the reasons why we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and more complex.
Sometimes, we chose to solve big problems.
Could we go to Mars if we can go to Mars if you can."
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars it would require a political decision that was popular, and that will never happen.
We're not going to go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the world's energy consumption is from energy sources like solar -- wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
Coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want sources of alternative energy that can compete on price to be on the price.
Now, technologists, the entrepreneurs and economists are according to what policies and economists are according to the development of an effective energy development, which is a significant increase in research and development development, and some kind of price control.
But there is no hope in the political climate of that we're going to see an energy energy policy or the international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, big problems that seem technological, they turn out not to be.
We know from time that famines are a result of failure in the <unk>
But 30 years of research have been taught that famines are political crisis that affects the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like harvest or systems for the storage and the systems for the storage and supply of food, but there will be famines while there were bad governments.
And finally, big problems sometimes we have a solution because we don't understand the problem.
President Nixon was declared war in 1971, but we soon discovered that there are many types of cancer, some terribly resistant to the treatment, and only in the last 10 years, they seem to have found effective treatments and viable.
The hard problems are difficult.
It's not true that we can't solve problems with technology.
We can and we have these four elements of being <unk> and the population leaders and the population must want to want to solve the problem, the institutions must support <unk> should be really a <unk> problem, and we need to understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, it comes with those criteria.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There is no <unk> competition, like the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy who <unk> the hard and dangerous, and there is no popular mythology of science fiction like <unk> the solar system.
In general, going to the moon turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And really, I wasn't even <unk> no problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to get.
God knows that we don't miss the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start with <unk> ideas that have about trust.
They're so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there's been a great decrease of trust, it's a very widespread belief in it.
The second is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third is a <unk> we should reclaim confidence.
I think the goal of the target and the task has been <unk>
What I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a target and a task, which I think gives you a clearest idea about the subject.
First of all, why do people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
I bow to think that it may have dropped in some activities or institutions and that could have increased in others.
I don't have that.
But I can turn into opinion surveys and opinion surveys are supposed to be the source of the belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at opinion polls over time, there's no evidence of it.
I mean, the people who were <unk> about 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, they follow <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago, they are still quite <unk> the North nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly half a way.
But it's this evidence for enough?
What surveys are <unk> are, of course, opinion.
What else can they do?
What you see are <unk> attitudes that people manifests themselves when you ask certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if somebody said, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> on the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
You probably would be able to say, "What do what?"
And that would be a very <unk> response.
And you could say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust some, but in other <unk>
Which is very rational.
In the end, in real life, we tend to make confidence <unk>
We don't assume that the level of confidence that we're going to feel for a certain kind of official <unk> and the type of person, it's going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, say I trust a certain elementary teacher that I know to give you the writing class, but at no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it was not a good <unk>
I could trust my friend more <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, perhaps, to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we had those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we leave the whole knowledge when we think about trust in a more unequal way.
I think these surveys are very bad tools to measure the real level of real trust, because they are trying to <unk> the good judgment of trusting something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's an stupid.
This is not that goal that I <unk>
I would encourage you to have more confidence in what is <unk> of trust, but not what it is.
Ultimately, I'm a <unk> of trust not <unk>
And I think that those people who <unk> their savings with the very <unk> called Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, I think about them, I think, well, yes, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not an intelligent goal in this life.
You know, deposited or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you say, yes, it says, yes, this means that what matters first is not trust, but the trustworthiness.
What it's about to make a judgment of how trustworthy people are in certain ways.
And I think that to be able to do a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if you find that one person is <unk> in the <unk> and it's responsible and honest -- then we'll have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be <unk>
But if, on the contrary, they're not accountable, we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest but not <unk> in them to take a letter to the <unk> because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that you can do certain things, but I see it <unk> their own <unk>
And I'm happy to say that I don't have a lot of friends who are <unk> and responsible for us but extremely <unk>
If it's like that, I still haven't been <unk>
But that's what we're looking for, you will get the way that confidence.
Trust is the answer.
The <unk> is what we have to be <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
In the last decades, we've been trying to build accountability and accountability for all sorts of institutions, professional officials and others, that make us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
A lot of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work as a <unk>
I remember once I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you will see the problem is it takes more time to do the traffic <unk> that will attend to sleep.
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and we need to argue that the accountability system which is destined to ensure <unk> and evidence of <unk> actually is doing the opposite.
What they do is <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard tasks like the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> as we say.
You may all know similar examples.
So let's get rid of that, by the target.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if we are going to be worthy of being worthy of trust, and we will tell people that we are trustworthy and if we try to determine whether other people, officials or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the trial, the simple actions, the <unk> what it doesn't do properly.
Third, the task.
<unk> the task to rebuild trust, puts things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should reconstruct trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
Can we reconstruct a little bit of trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people together, trying to improve confidence.
But trust, ultimately, it's kind of signature to us because they provide other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them the foundations enough for you to trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't <unk> by all people, all the time.
But you also have to contribute <unk> evidence that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do that?
That does every day, everywhere, everywhere, the common people, the <unk> the institutions, very effectively.
Let me give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks says I can help me with no choice.
I'm wearing it and give me the money, or they change it by the color I want.
That's great. I trust them because they were vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson on that.
If you get vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust and you have confidence in what you're saying.
So, in the end, I think that what we're pointing at is not a very difficult thing to <unk>
What people trust is in relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when and how the other person is worthy of confidence.
Thank you.
From the beginning of computers we have come up with <unk> by reducing the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material world and the world of the screen in which the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has gone increasingly and more and more, to such a point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of glass, <unk> and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if I didn't have any <unk>
So I started to imagine how it would be <unk>
So first I created this tool that gets deeper into digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the screen is the transfer of the physical body in the pixel in the pixel way.
Designers can prescribe their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool you break the barriers.
But two hands remain still out of the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using all the dexterity of your hands?
In the division of Science <unk> at Microsoft, with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a small space on the keyboard on a digital area of work.
It will be a transparent bombsight with chambers of depth to detecting your fingers and face, now you can lift the hands of the keyboard, get inside of 3D space and grab pixels directly with your hands.
As the windows and the files have a location in real space, <unk> it's as easy to grab a book from a <unk>
You can flip through the book and highlight lines or words with the virtual touch sensor that there are down on the floating screen.
The architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with your hands.
So in these examples, we have <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we do that digital information comes towards us?
<unk> many of us will be bought and carefully by the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device on your head or <unk> when the system is understanding the geometry of your body.
If we take this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how we can make it be physicists so we can <unk> and <unk>
How would a future like this?
In the MIT Media Lab with my <unk> Hiroshi Ishii, and my collaborator <unk> Post, this only physical pixel there.
This magnet, <unk> acts as a 3D pixel in space, which means that both computer as users can move the object anywhere inside this little three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
And by programming the object, we release the object, we release it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and go back to reproduce and stay forever in the physical world.
You can teach <unk> physically and distance and the famous shot from Michael Jordan can be played as a physical reality that we want to.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts as the movement of planets, the physics, unlike the monitors or textbooks, this is a real and palpable experience that you can touch and feel.
But what is more fascinating than changing the physical part of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our physical activities itself.
As you see, digital information is not just going to show you something but to start acting directly over us as part of the physical world around us without having to <unk> ourselves from our world.
So we started the talk today about a barrier, but if you put that barrier, the only limit that is left is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was thrilled to become a <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the 1960s.
When I was in the first grade, the government wanted to take a school to athletes with all expenses paid.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After the survival of the Islamic Revolution, they create firmly that there was only an accurate way towards <unk> a safe and good job.
No matter if the work I'd like or not.
But my dream was to be an Chinese opera singer singer though.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer has to start <unk> from very young people to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could go to the opera school.
I even wrote to the director of the school and the host of a radio show.
But no adult would give up the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Only my friends told me, but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15, I knew it was too much more to train.
My dream is never <unk>
I would argue that during the rest of my life a second class was all the only one to aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to look for another <unk>
No one to me, I wanted to <unk> OK.
We went to books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I came to the United States in 1995, and what were the first books that I read here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about Chinese Chinese life.
And it's not a psychological propaganda <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but strange.
That's a topic for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> to your father and your mother."
I said, "It's so different, and much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to come out of this <unk> trap and to reset the relationship with my parents.
And the encounter with a new culture also gave me place to my reading machine.
And so many perspectives.
So for example, this map seemed to me, because this is what students in China learn.
I had never occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
<unk> reading is not a new thing.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are to research camps like religion comparative and literature.
<unk> and <unk> offers academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought if reading comparative work worked for research, why not do it as well.
So I started reading books.
They can be <unk> <unk> by Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who were involved in a same <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For <unk> <unk> are economic and spiritual <unk>
For Buddha, they're all <unk> lust, fear and <unk> <unk>
If you know other language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> path to <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Instead of getting lost in the translation, I found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that <unk> in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> <unk>
The books opened me a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I will not be able to feel like I used to feel like <unk>
Having a dream is really not compared to what many other people have <unk>
I've come to believe that realization is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams, come from, where the passion, where happiness comes from.
A <unk> dream can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, which today I'm here, happy, happy, living again with purpose and clarity, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you -- Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first customer <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology in Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman named <unk>
Alex came into the first session using jeans and a <unk> <unk> threw up on the couch, my office took off my shoes and told me that I wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My roommate had a <unk> like a <unk>
And I was a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the biblical stories, that Alex brought up to the <unk> it made me easy to move your head as they pass on the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> he said, Alex, and so I was right.
You start to work afterwards, you get home later, you have children later, to death later.
For the <unk> as Alex and I had time to <unk>
But shortly after, my squad <unk> pushed me to press Alex that I would talk about his life <unk>
I love me.
I said, "Sure, he's coming out with guys under his category, <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not like it was to marry him."
And then my squad <unk> said, "No, no, but maybe it will be <unk> on the next.
In addition, the best time to work on the marriage of Alex is before they <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel head after what they <unk> but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex were a pause in their development.
This made the Alex <unk> the perfect time, and we were <unk>
So I realized, this kind of recklessness that was a real problem and had real consequences, not only for Alex and his loving life, but for the careers, families and the future of the <unk>
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
That means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think that nobody comes to adulthood without spending before the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, Yes! They're amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> you remove a dream -- I want to see. All right, <unk> the <unk> really matter.
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will happen to the 35 years.
That means eight of every 10 and experiences and experiences and moments that give you a way to your life will have happened to be 30 and <unk>
People from more than 40, I don't stop in panic.
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a race has an exponential impact on the amount of money that they <unk>
We know that more than half Americans are married, they live or are coming out with their future partner at 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up their second and last stage of growth in their <unk> and they are <unk> for <unk> which means that if there's something you want to change yourself, now is the moment to change it.
We know that personality changes more times during their <unk> than any other time in life, and we know that the female fertility comes to its top at 28 and the things become complicated to the <unk>
<unk> are the time to focus on their body and their options.
When we think about development, we all know that the first five years are crucial to language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment where its everyday life and common life has an impact on the person who is <unk>
But what we don't hear is that there is something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
The newspapers speak about changes in the time of the <unk>
The researchers call <unk> a extended <unk>
<unk> would tell the <unk> names of the <unk> like <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines the <unk>
Leonard <unk> said that to make great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
Isn't it true?
What do you think happens when you give a <unk> in your head and you say, "You have another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and her ambition and it is absolutely nothing.
And then every single day -- intelligent, interesting things like you or your kids and daughters get to my office and say something like this: "I know my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship doesn't know. I'm just killing time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that while I start a race before 30, everything is okay."
But then it starts to sound like this: "My <unk> are <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better copy the day I graduated from the <unk>
And then it starts sounding something like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the chairs.
They were all running and <unk> but then somewhere around the 30, it turned into the music and they all started sitting.
I didn't want to be the only one who would stay standing, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when he was <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit right, but the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for <unk> there's a huge pressure to the 30 and so many of you start a career, choose a city, and have two or three children in a much more short period of time.
So many of these things are not <unk> and there are research that starts to show, which is much more difficult and uncomfortable to do everything in the <unk>
The middle age crisis is not about buying red sports cars.
It's about realizing that you can't have the race you want now.
You realize you can't have the son you want to do, or you can't give a brother to your son.
Many <unk> and <unk> you see themselves themselves, and to me, sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was I doing? What was I thinking?"
I want to change what the audience are doing and thinking.
Here is a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman named <unk>
By 25, Emma came to my office because it was in his own words, having a identity.
He said he would like to work in art or in entertainment, but still couldn't decide, so I spent the last years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper, she lived with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And in spite of living a very difficult <unk> his life before had been even more difficult.
They were frequently frequently in our <unk> but then she was getting up to say, "You don't choose his family to say, "You don't choose his friends."
Well, one day Emma got his head on his legs and he cried for almost every time.
He had just bought a new book <unk> and I had spent the whole morning <unk> with his many little <unk> but then he stayed looking at the empty space that follows after the words, "In emergency case, "Please call <unk>
I was at the point of <unk> when he saw me and he said, "Who is going to be for me if I have an accident <unk>
Who is going to take care of whether it gives me <unk>
At that time, it took me a lot of work to resist and not say, <unk>
What she needed was not a <unk> that really <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as you just sit as the decade <unk> of Emma going on.
So, for the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all <unk> man or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I said to Emma that would be <unk> from that crisis of identity and <unk> capital capital.
For identity, I mean to do something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what they want to be next.
I didn't know the future of <unk> and nobody knows the future of work, but I know this: identity capital creates identity.
So now it's time for that work on the other side of the country, from that <unk> that you want to try it.
I'm not going to be inspired by exploration -- I'm looking at the exploration that shouldn't be <unk> which, by the way, is not exploration, by the way.
It's <unk>
I said to Emma that would explore jobs and make it count.
Second, I said to Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you at the airport, but the <unk> who come together with friends with similar minds are limited to whom you know, what you know, how they think about how they talk, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who comes out almost always comes from the nearest circle.
new things come from what they're called weak ties friends from their friends.
Yeah, half the <unk> have a bad job or don't have a job.
But the other half no, and the weak bonds are the way we get to this group.
The half of the <unk> <unk> never <unk> then meet the head of your neighbor is the way you get a job not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information is happening.
For the last but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose her family, but I know your friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as a <unk> Emma soon loved her family, when you have a couple and it form his own family.
I said to Emma that the time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 is better age to sit than 20 or even 25 and even 25 and I agree with you.
But to choose the person that you live now, or you're going to tell you, when everybody on Facebook begin to walk towards the <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have, and that means to be as intentional in love as you're at work.
You know, your family must be a conscious choice of who and what you want instead of just making it work or kill time with anyone who will get them to you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the roommate in a classroom that was working in a museum of art in another state.
This weak bond was helped to get a job there.
That labor supply gave him a reason to leave boyfriend, with living with.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special in museums.
This married man who chose consciously <unk>
<unk> his new career, she loves her new family, and I sent myself a letter that said, "Now the spaces of emergency contacts are not good enough.
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love about working with <unk>
It's very easy to help them.
The <unk> are like planes coming out from the airport to Los Angeles, who come to some place in the West.
Just before the <unk> a light fits in its trajectory makes the difference between land in Alaska or in <unk>
In the same way, at 21 or 25 and even the <unk> a good conversation, a good <unk> a good TED Talk can have huge effects over the years or even in the next generation.
Here's my idea of spreading all the <unk> you know.
It's as simple as what I learned to say to <unk>
That's what I now have the privilege of telling the <unk> as Emma every day: the <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get identity capital, use their weak ties pick your family.
Don't let me define what they didn't know or what they didn't know.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left very hard work in management management for a job that was even more <unk>
I went to teach them mathematics to graduate students in New York City public schools.
And as any teacher, I did tests and tests.
Let me give you tasks.
When the job comes back, I would take grades.
What struck me is that <unk> was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of the people who had a better performance had no I.Q. I.Q.
Some of my smartest kids were not going so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of thing you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, safe, they're <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that each of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard for enough.
After several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know about how to measure better ways.
It's the <unk> but what happens if you succeed in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn in a rapid and easy?
So I left the classrooms, and I went to college to become a <unk>
I started studying kids and adults in all sorts of scenarios <unk> and every single study my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> West <unk>
And we're trying to predict what they were going to do in the military training and who are <unk>
We went to the National <unk> National <unk> and we tried to predict what children they were going to be able to do the farther away in the competition.
We studied professors and working in really difficult neighborhoods and working in really difficult neighborhoods to be teaching at the end of school and <unk> who will be the most effective at improving the outcomes of their <unk>
We partnered with private companies, asking me, which of these sellers are going to keep their <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all these very different contexts, arose a feature as a significant <unk> of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, physical health and wasn't <unk>
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and perseverance to achieve very long-term goals.
<unk> is having a resistance.
The determination is clinging to its future, day after day, not just a week, not only for the month, but for years and working hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is living life as if it was a <unk> not a long-term career.
A few years ago, I started studying determination in public schools in Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students that made my determination of determination and then waited for more than a year to see who <unk>
It turns out that the children with more determination had significantly increased <unk> even when the <unk> in every trait that I could measure, things like family income, the results of the tests, even safety that they felt children when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point or in the National <unk> of <unk> where the <unk> is also at school, especially for children at risk of <unk>
For me, the most powerful about determination is how little we know how much science knows about it.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do the determination in children?
What should I do to teach kids a solid job <unk>
How do I keep them motivated for the long <unk>
The most honest answer is: I don't know.  What I know is that talent is not <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals who just don't go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the determination of it is commonly related to or is even related to talent.
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing determination in children is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea that was developed at Stanford University by Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change with effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and it grows in response to the challenge, they're much more likely to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't believe that failure is a permanent condition.
So the growth mindset is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where I finish my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have to go ahead.
We need to take our best ideas, our greatest intuitions and we need to be <unk>
We need to measure whether they have been successful and we have to be willing to fail, to <unk> to start everything again with the lessons <unk>
In other words, we need to be certain about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan like the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories is my mother <unk> the beauty, the shape and the shape of the Chinese characters.
And from that moment, I was struck by this incredible language.
But for a foreigner. It looks like the Great Wall China.
In the last few years, I've been asking if I can break down this <unk> so anyone who wants to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method of learning can be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each of the strokes of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese academic spends 20 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic literacy.
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of basic literature enough to read traffic signals, menus to understand the basic idea of web pages or newspapers.
Today I'll start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
Open your mouth as much as you might be able to be <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to take a ride.
<unk>
If the form of fire is a person with arms in both sides, as if I were shouting in a <unk> way, <unk> I am <unk> This symbol is actually <unk> in the form of the flame -- but I like to believe that it's the other way.
This is a tree.
tree tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of <unk> from a <unk> in the old West.
And I call this eight characters.
These are building blocks so they create many more characters.
One person.
If somebody walks back, that's <unk>
As the old saying, two is company, three are crowd.
If one person stretch out their arms, this person is saying <unk> so big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
This is a secure such as <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree. Two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we have the forest.
Put a table underneath the tree, we have the <unk>
Put a mouth on the tree, and that's a <unk>  <unk> from remember, because a speaker is quite an idiot.
Do you remember fire?
Two guys together, it's very hot.
Three together, that's a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together.
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon shining together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
A door, put a table inside the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, ask questions.
<unk> has someone at home?
This person is getting hidden out of a gate, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, they're <unk>
So we've been about 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight <unk> will allow you to build 32.
The next eight characters are building other 32.
So with every little effort, they will be able to learn a couple of hundreds of characters, which is the same thing that you learn a Chinese for eight years.
So after I know the characters, we started to create sentences.
For example, the mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the land of the sun <unk>
This is a sun, put up with the origin, because Japan is in this from China.
So a sun in the beginning, we created Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left is two stacked mountains onto the other.
In ancient China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> the Chinese enemies to their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the diaspora has become a <unk>
A mouth that tells you where to go out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking to and go down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be Dad is the movies I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the Oz of Oz together.
The movie <unk> his imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave a good excuse to use a brilliant dress and bring a magic wand
But when you see that film so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and we raise our children in a kind of a complex fantasy of childhood fantasy show.
However, the Oz magician was an event itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend actually took a rise to 40 years later with, interestingly, another film whose <unk> a metal boy and a <unk> boy would join a girl dressed as a guard guard from the enemy.
Do you know what I'm talking about?  Yes.
There's a big difference between these two films, there are a couple of big differences between the magician magician and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there are very little violence in the magician in <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like <unk>
But I think that if the Oz was done today, the magician would say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz as the self-fulfilling prophecy.
<unk> magical shoes to defeat the armies made by the computer <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing in the magician of Oz is that the most amazing characters and even <unk> are women.
I started to notice this when I did watching "Star <unk> to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that moment, I also had a child.
Just three years.
He was not invited to be projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the gold level of oversight had <unk>  And so she slid in the room and she was impressed like a mom in her <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was happening, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
They would be about value, resilience and <unk>
So the sense that Luke is one to an army to <unk> the government?
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk>
How do you make Dorothy your film?
They are doing good <unk> with everybody and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow up with, and not a world of men that <unk> which is where we are.
Why is there so much force in political capital in the movies for our children, and so little on the road of <unk>
There's a lot of literature about the impact of the movies of male violence in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know by experience that the princess <unk> doesn't give me the proper framework that I would have served to navigate the world of adults who are <unk>  I think at the moment of the first joke, I really expected that you could come up with you because it's the end of the film, right?
My search is finished, I have a <unk>
Why keep it standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies are focused on <unk> to <unk> and get their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like being a child, you have to be a dumb animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> suit.
There are a lot of exceptions, and to stand at the <unk> from Disney to any of you.
But they send a message to children, even though they, the guys, they're not really their target audience.
They do a phenomenal job by teaching girls how to defend themselves against <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend themselves from <unk>
There is no model for them.
We also have some big women who write new stories for our children, so real and lovely and <unk> but they don't stop being movie movies.
Of course, the most successful theme of all times continues to appear in classic after classic each one of them on the adventure of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who make a little girl.
As much as many of you are thinking, this year, finally came back.
I recommend all of you. It's already available in stores.
Remember what criticism said when he came out of it.
I can't believe that Pixar has made a movie of a <unk>
Is it good good. Don't let it be <unk>
Well, almost none of these movies passes the <unk> test.
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It still has no roots and already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book <unk> and in the <unk> I recorded a conversation that had had a friend about the assessment of the movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that you should say, in the film, there's more than a female character who has lines?
So you have to fulfill the <unk>
These women talk to each other at some point in film?
Their conversations are about something else than the boy you like.  Okay? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen, and yet very rarely I see it in the cinema that we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good quality movie.
Right? <unk> <unk> success of <unk> a consensus idea, which is a Hollywood Hollywood film.
<unk> doesn't happen the test of <unk>
And I don't think that <unk> because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the film happens in a embassy where men and women were hiding during the <unk> crisis.
We have a lot of scenes of men who have deep and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the actors to take a look at the door, and say, <unk> to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's go through the numbers.
In 2011, in the 100 more popular movies, how many of them believe they have protagonists of them.
<unk> It's not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women we've chosen recently for Congress, then it's fine.
But there's a larger number that goes to <unk> this room.
Last year, The New York Times ran a study that the government had done.
This is what he was like, right?
In the United States, one in five women says it's been sexually assaulted in their life.
I don't think it's the fault of mass entertainment.
I don't think the movies for kids have something to do with that.
I also don't think that music videos or pornography are closely <unk> but something goes wrong, but when I hear that statistics, one of the things I think is that there's a lot of sexual <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are you <unk>
What do you do not get <unk>
They're <unk> the story that the role of a male hero is to defeat the <unk> with violence, and then charge the reward, which is a woman who doesn't have friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this really startling statistic and we want to <unk>
We have tools to our disposal as <unk> <unk> and we hope that that's going to happen, but I have to ask, "Is it going to be <unk> yes, at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our children to keep their power <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean mainly parents.
I think we have to show our male children a new definition of <unk>
The definition of man box, it's radically changing.
You've read about how the new economy is changing the role that we care about home and <unk>
Everything is changing.
When I asked my daughter what was his favorite character from "Star <unk> Do you know what I <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do these two?
Maybe it's not just the brilliant dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those films that know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help them achieve their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories in which to tell my <unk> Go and fight and fight only and more of the stories where her work is to join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people improve and be better people, like the magician magician in <unk>
Thank you.
As a child, I lived in Maine and one of the things that I liked was to look for the sea biscuits on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that that would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered with sand and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I would get back to <unk>
I started to see ways and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in love in love and <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized I saw with my own eyes not enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown to one of almost 1.3 miles of length with the <unk>
And my biscuits had grown to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite imagery.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to do it differently.
I want to show you an example of how different we see the <unk>
This is a place in the eastern Delta. of Egypt called <unk>
And the place, it seems to be brown, but when we use infrared and process it using fake color, suddenly the place looks like pink <unk>
What you're seeing is the real chemical changes of the landscape of the <unk> and the activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we used satellite data to find an old city, old city called <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the old Egypt of the ancient Egypt for over 400 years in a period of time called the Middle East about 4,000 years ago.
The place in the <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle East, there was this great renaissance of the ancient art and the architecture and religion.
The <unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> <unk> within red circles, but somewhere inside this huge <unk> <unk>
This area is huge. It's about <unk> per mile away.
Before, the Nile <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, I moved into this and covered the whole city.
So how do you find a city <unk> in a <unk> landscape.
And I'll try to find that at random it would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with your eyes, and using baseball.
So, we use NASA data to make a map of the place, with very subtle changes.
We were able to see where the <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this slightly elevated area that you see inside the circle here, which we think might be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with Egyptians doing jobs of <unk> you can see it here.
When I say <unk> it's like the sample of it shows on ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we seek layers of human <unk>
Five meters down, under a thick layer of <unk> we found a dense layer of <unk>
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five feet down, we have a <unk> layer of <unk> several hundred years to date from the Middle East, exactly the same period as we think it's <unk>
We also found the work of <unk> <unk> quartz and <unk> what shows that there was a <unk> shop.
This might seem that it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones used to the jewelry, the Middle East, these are the stones that are <unk>
So, we have a dense <unk> of occupation that goes back from the Middle Empire.
We also have evidence of an elite jewelry shop that demonstrates that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still haven't found it <unk> here, but we would go to the place in a near future for <unk>
And more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also perform great discoveries.
I want to finish with my favorite quote from the Roman Empire, probably written in <unk> four years ago:
And to share knowledge is the most of all the <unk>
There's nothing like that on the ground.
So I mean, TED was not founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do ideas actually happen in 1984 B.C. in a living city not for a long time and found from the high.
It certainly puts the search of <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, in front of the door of <unk>
I want you to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that he's made.
Now <unk> a group of <unk> <unk>
They are competing in a racing career and go in direction to their <unk>
I need you to see this <unk>
They are <unk> they're <unk> they're <unk>
They collide against the door of their house.
There are bikes flying everywhere, wheels that go on its side, rays of the wheels that end up in <unk> places -- the threshold of the door, you know.
So in <unk> to the hallway or what there's the other side of the door, and look at the quality of the light, light shining on the <unk> of the <unk>
It's waving with your hand.
From his chair, on a brown horse.
It's a horse that talks about.
You can feel your blue <unk> you can tickle your nose.
You can smell the <unk> <unk> and you think it's about to get into the mouth.
<unk> on one side and enter their living room.
Already in the room, and making maximum use of his imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
It's with little clothes, dancing on his center <unk> singing <unk> <unk> One More <unk>
Now let's go to the kitchen.
The ground has been covered with a path of yellow bricks and from the oven come to you -- <unk> Man -- the <unk> and the Len, <unk> of <unk> <unk> of the hands, jumping up to you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a particular competition, which is conducted every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk>
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a journalist, <unk> waiting, I guess, this would be like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few different ladies and different habits of sanitation.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers -- look at them just once.
They put the names of tens and tens of strangers.
We have entire poems in just minutes.
And I was able to see who could memorize the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was like, "This is <unk>
These people must be images of nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This, is a man named Ed <unk> who had come from England and has one of the best <unk>
I said, <unk> when you realized you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I'm not a wise.
Actually, I have an average memory.
Everyone involved in this competition say that they have normal memory.
We were trained to perform these miraculous memory acts using some old techniques invented in Greece, and a half thousand years ago in Greece, the same techniques that used <unk> to memorize their speeches, and that the <unk> academics used to memorize <unk>
And my reaction was, <unk> How did I have no heard of this <unk>
We were standing out of the hall of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful and brilliant English guy, but a little bit of <unk> he said, <unk> you're an American journalist,
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I'd like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order on a deck of cards in national television in national TV.
That will prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start for a <unk>
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey to me.
And I ended up spending most of the next year, not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what your potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He is <unk> very probably with the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that I had a problem of <unk> it's awesome.
Somebody incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allowed to see until what extent our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> He was based on the role of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We spent a afternoon in the public library.
And by coming back, I read a number of treaties about writing writing something over 2,000 years ago in Latin, in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things that I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having this idea of having a disciplined and disciplined <unk> wasn't one thing as rare as it can look like today.
A long time, people invest in their memory, to provide their minds.
These techniques have made us possible our modern world, but they also have changed.
We have changed the <unk> and I would argue that they have also changed the cognitive form.
Because we have no need to remember, sometimes it seems that we have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you still find people who are passionate about this idea of a disciplined and disciplined memory is this particular competition of memory.
It's actually not that <unk> there are skills like this around the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers from London College invited a group of mine, to the lab.
They wanted to know that it has brains in some sense, structural or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are they more intelligent than <unk>
They gave them a cognitive test, and the answer was actually no.
There was yet a really interesting difference and meaningful difference between the brains of the memory of memory and the subjects of control with that <unk>
When they put them in an <unk> MRI machine, <unk> his brains as they <unk> numbers, expensive faces and forms of <unk> they found that in the memory of memory is <unk> parts of the brain, different people.
They actually <unk> or seemed like <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial memory and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament of <unk> <unk> is managing as an armed race in where each year, somebody comes up with a new way of remembering more things, and then the rest of the competitors must get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times an memory.
On his desk in front of him, there are 36 <unk> of cards -- <unk> that he's about to try to memorize on an hour, using a technique that he invented and only he <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits <unk>
<unk> Yes.
And while there is a lot of ways to remember things in these <unk> absolutely all the techniques used by the end of the way that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It illustrates with a elegant paradox known as the paradox of <unk> <unk> he says this: I say two people who remember the same word. I say to you, you know, there's a man named <unk>
That's his <unk>
And then I ask you, <unk> there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I asked them to tell you that word I told you a <unk>
So what do you do?
The person who said that his name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who said that his job is <unk>
The same word, different capacity to <unk> that's weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name Baker, it doesn't really mean for you. It doesn't have any relationship to you.
And with all the other memories that dance on their head.
But the word <unk> We know <unk>
They use <unk> <unk>
They have <unk>
They do well when they go home to work.
Probably some <unk>
And when we <unk> that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some later later.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this goes back two two years ago in the Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of the <unk>
The story says this: There was a poet called <unk> which I attended a <unk>
They had been hired as entertainment, because before, if she wanted to give a very good party, not brought to a <unk> <unk>
He stood up -- he <unk> his memory, and he was <unk> and it was as soon as he left, the <unk> <unk>
Let's go to everyone.
But not only killed everyone, but it shattered the bodies of <unk> <unk>
No one could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting there.
So they could not be <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
<unk> standing outside, only survivor, in the middle of the rubble, closed the eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where I had been sitting every little bit.
I took the family of the <unk> hand where they were their loved ones between the rubble.
What <unk> <unk> at that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and it is that no matter whether we're not good at remembering names or numbers of phone or instructions for the word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and spatial memory.
If you ask them to tell you, the first 10 words of the story I've just told you about <unk> is very likely to find them very hard to do it.
But I would bet that if you told you to say who I was sitting on the horse speaker, brown in his <unk> would be able to <unk>
The idea of the memory palace is to create this building with the eyes of your mind and the <unk> of the things that you want to remember -- the more crazy -- the more crazy -- the more it wants to remember -- the more the image, the more <unk>
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first treaties of memory, in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say that you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to do it from memory, the same way that I would have done it, if you had invited him to <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you might do is imagine that they're on the door of your house.
And to come up with some kind of an absolutely ridiculous, crazy image and <unk> to help them remember that the first thing you want to mention is that completely <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine entering your house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> mounted on Mister <unk>
And that would remind you that they want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to tell.
And then in the kitchen, and the fourth theme that they would talk would be that bizarre journey that they did for a whole year, and they have some friends to help you remember it.
That's like <unk> <unk> <unk> the narratives of word -- not word for word, which is going to confuse it but typical by typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a remnant of when people thought about <unk> and in rhetoric with this sort of spatial terms.
The phrase <unk> would be like the first place in his bedroom.
I saw this was just fascinating, and I got into that.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing a big thing about this <unk> of competitive <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is an event, boring.
And seriously, it's like seeing a lot of people sitting by taking exams. I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone is <unk>
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things going on in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in his place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before you sit at the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an ancient <unk> school bought in a <unk> market.
And I discovered that this was entertaining.
I would never have expected you to do it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training the memory.
What is actually about doing is better and more and more of the ability to create and imagine these images that are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I was really hooked on this.
This is me, using my standard team training for memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and a covered with tape, leaving just two <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of a memory <unk>
And I ended up coming back to the same contest that he had covered a year before, and I had the idea that I could put into a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this could serve for good <unk> for my whole research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something I didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's nice to be able to memorize electronics, and phone numbers, and it's actually not the point.
These are just <unk> tricks.
Because they're based on pretty basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to be able to build <unk> from memory or memorize <unk> to benefit from a little bit of insights about how their minds works.
We often talk about people with great memory as if it was a gift <unk> but it's not the case.
The big memories are <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focus on.
The palace of <unk> These are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make us <unk>
It would be sort of deep processing -- a kind of complete attention that most of them is not <unk>
But the reality is that there is no shortcuts.
That's how things do <unk>
And if there is something I want to leave you with today, is what I was talking about, the <unk> that I could not even remember that I had a memory problem, I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we going to lose from what is our short existence in the <unk> or <unk> not by paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walks to our side -- we will be so <unk> that we don't even get to process <unk>
I learned from first hand that there are incredible memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a life -- you must be the kind of person you remember remember.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of architecture history.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex issue, so you can just take a place in New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I am from <unk> and I was living in the home of my parents in a village called <unk> and this was my bedroom.
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom that I shared with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And there they all spent the time watching television -- so every time I went from my room to the bathroom, all of me looked at me, and every time I stood up, and I would come back wrapped up on one towel, all of me.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> unsure and I hated it.
He took that journey, hated that <unk> hated that room and that house.
That's the architecture.
All right.
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt -- that's the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, and it's not about mathematics, and it's not in the areas, but of those connections that are emotional <unk> that we feel in the places that we have <unk>
And it's not surprising that we feel that way, because according to the Environmental <unk> Environmental Protection Agency spend 90 percent of their time under roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time we are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
architecture determines us in ways we don't even notice it.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means when I show you a building like this, I know what you would tell you, you think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know that they think about it based on a building built half a half thousand years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that the architects use to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's an <unk> emotional connection, we've used this trick for a long, long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We used it in the 19th century to build art museums.
And in the 20th century in America, we use it to build houses.
See, these <unk> stable, <unk> in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because to build things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
The people who are <unk> and governments, are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use shapes that know they're going to work.
So we found ourselves with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the Public Public Library. He ended in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, has a <unk> you have this round thing, and red brick -- that you leave <unk> what you're trying to communicate with this <unk> the kids, the human <unk>
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year in 2004, in 2004, on the other side of the country, he ended up another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and sharing.
So what is it possible in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, two buildings, are all so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works at the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is the <unk> the architects constantly drive new technologies -- new new technologies -- new solutions for the forms of life today.
We were going to stop and we gave it so much, we get away from the people.
And all of the black -- this is <unk> you think we feel very well, but we're dead because we don't have another option.
We need to go on the other side and go back to those <unk> symbols.
So we do that, and we are all happy, but we feel like <unk> So we start experimenting with <unk> we can swing the back and go over and over and over and over and over over the last 300 years, and of course, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago, <unk> in the 1970s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the so-called <unk>
It has to do with the concrete.
Can you guess.
<unk> small <unk> on scale.
Something really hard.
So we are approaching the '80s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
<unk> the New Year's back in the other direction.
We take those kinds of ways we know and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we add bake and we use new materials.
They love it.
We don't give <unk>
We took <unk> and we made them a skyscraper, that can be <unk> <unk>
The shapes were <unk> won in boldness and <unk>
The <unk> became columns of <unk>
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
crazy.
But it was the 1980s, that was great.
We all spent the time on business centers, we move to the neighborhoods, and there in the suburbs, we can create our own fantasies of <unk>
Those fantasies were able to be at the basis of French or Italian or Italian.
Maybe with a <unk> of bread.
This is what happens to the <unk>
This is what happens with symbols.
They're easy, they're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, recreating memories of other places.
I know very well, and you all know that this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
The architects feel frustrated and we started to swing the pendulum back in the other direction.
In the 1980s and early '90s, we started to experiment with called <unk>
<unk> the symbols of the <unk> we now have new design techniques to be a computer, and we found ourselves with new <unk> a few ways that will be addressed against other forms.
This is an academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> One stays totally <unk>
Normally, the <unk> <unk> in the opposite direction.
But then something <unk>
In 1997, the building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building fundamentally changed the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when I critical academic and public <unk> they were totally agreed on a building.
The New York Times <unk> this construction of <unk>
<unk> in Bilbao grew up in a half thousand percent when the building.
So suddenly, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first <unk> star.
But how is it possible that these wild shapes and <unk> how it's possible to become ubiquitous across the world?
And it happened, because the media is <unk> around them and quickly learned that those forms of culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
They did the top mayors in the world.
So they all believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon in the beginning of the new millennium, with other star architects.
He went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects in the threshold of the new millennium, actually starting to go through all the architecture, digital media started to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think about it, for example, how they use architecture.
A thousand years ago, they would have to have been walked up to the next town to see a building.
<unk> can be <unk> you can take a boat, an airplane, you can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we are all photographers of architecture, and the building gets beyond their physical location in the end.
architecture is everywhere, that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture moves so fast.
It doesn't look for a long time to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years old, and in that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 buildings more, before I heard that I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
This is how we found ourselves with buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a <unk> movement for 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That's never going to happen to happen, because we're in the threshold of the biggest revolution in architecture from the invention of the steel or the lift, and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when you apply it to media, it starts to swing faster and faster to be in both extremes almost <unk> and actually <unk> the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, architects and you, the public.
Now we can make symbols almost <unk> with emotional load of something completely new.
Let me show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that was <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York.
It's a community of vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, the building, was already part of the community, and as the drawings looked like exactly the product done, it was not surprises.
The building came to be part of the community. That first summer, when people started to get and share it in social media, the building stopped being a building, became a media, because these are not just images of a building, are the images that you made from the building.
And as you use it to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes it <unk> with collective memory, and by carrying these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need to tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other about what we think about architecture, because digital media has not only changed the relationship between us, but they've changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building was built today, first of the Internet is looking for <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of innovation, about what a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that can lead to the mayor of <unk> people from <unk> and tell them that there is no unique response to what a library is today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions is the freedom of experience.
It's all different now.
The architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use words <unk> and sort of complicated, and one is no longer an <unk> audience, which is no accepts something that hasn't seen before.
The architects can listen, and you don't leave yourself through architecture.
That means that the <unk> <unk> from one style to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find similar solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different from the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad <unk> historical brick with ideas of what is supposed to be <unk>
This means that a few robots will be able to build our buildings, because we will finally be ready for the shapes that are going to produce.
That means that buildings will become the <unk> of nature and not the reverse.
This means that a parking garage in Miami Beach, Florida, it can also serve to make sports or <unk> or even one can marry at night.
This means that three architects can dream with swimming on the East <unk> of New York, and raising half a million dollars of the community attached around that cause, it's not a customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot that builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what we care is what we build.
The architects know how to make buildings more <unk> more intelligent and more kind.
We've been waiting for all of you to do.
Finally, we are no longer <unk>
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot to play.
Buildings don't just reflect our society, but they give them a way to the other <unk> spaces, local libraries -- homes where we form our children, and the step of the bedroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and started walking.
And it makes it quite a typical of the children of a year, <unk> as if his body was moving too fast for her legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that you really like to do is look in the mirror.
She really loves her reflection.
<unk> <unk> and it gives itself these big kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all his friends do this, and my mom tells me that I used to do it, and he asked me to think, when's when I stopped doing this?
How is it that we don't suddenly love with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking for a Google: "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old, and lives in <unk>
And as any teenager, I just want to be dear and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for next week in school.
It's a little bit confused and a little bit confused because, even though his mom tells him all the time that is beautiful, every day in school, somebody tells him it's ugly.
Among what his mom tells him and what his friends, or friends of school, they say, you don't know who you believe.
So a video of her itself, he publishes it on YouTube, and ask others for you to leave a <unk> "I'm nice or I'm <unk>
Okay, so far, <unk> has received more than 13,000 comment.
Some of these are so <unk> that it's not even worth thinking about them.
We talk about a normal and normal teenager, who gets these answers in one of the stages of their life most emotionally emotionally.
Thousands of people are posting videos like this, in their most teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what are you doing to do this?
Well, the teenagers of today are almost never alone.
They're under the line of being online and available all the time, talking, <unk> giving <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never over.
We have never been so connected, in a continuous way, so young.
As a mother told me, "It's like there's a party in your room all the <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures that go from hand with that are <unk>
This environment, of being always connected, it's <unk> our children to <unk> based on the number of liking them and the kinds of comments that they get.
There is no divide between a life online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what is real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what it's authentic and what we rigged digitally.
What is the most important thing about someone else's life, what is normal in a context of every day?
And where are you looking for <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> of the news of the girls now.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The <unk> technique is now once routine.
And the trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of you who call it, it means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what young people are.
But kids are not immune to this.
It's like the gold <unk> and the <unk>
But what is the problem with all this?
Well, we certainly want our kids to grow healthy and be smart individuals.
But in a culture obsessed with the image, we are teaching our children to spend more time and our mental effort to look at their appearance, the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like your relationships, the development of their physical skills, their studies and other aspects start to suffer.
Six of each 10 girls would prefer not to do something because they think they don't see good enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
They're fundamental activities for their growth as human beings and because of society and the field of labor development.
31 percent, almost one in three teenagers are not interested in the classroom.
One in five are not attending class at all the days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the season of tests, if you don't think you see you good, specifically if you don't think you're good enough, <unk> a smaller note to the average of your companions who don't care about that looks like this.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland, the United States and China.
And it gives itself regardless of what they actually weigh these young people.
So, for me to be good of course, we're talking about how you see you not what you really are.
The low self-esteem on their body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
<unk> teenagers doing less physical activity, they eat less fruit and vegetables, they engage in more not healthy diet than they can take to a food disorder than they can take to a food disorder.
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily <unk> by the people around them and are at greater risk of depression.
And we think that's all about what they make decisions more <unk> like alcohol consumption and drugs, <unk> surgery facial surgery, aesthetic and early ages and no protection and harm damage.
The search for perfect body is pushing the health care system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they have overweight again, regardless of whether or have no higher rates of <unk>
Fifty percent of women don't present to a job interview on a day where they don't feel safe in the way they see.
Think about a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
So if we could overcome this, what would that be like that period.
<unk> this potential is interest for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, by itself, it doesn't take you very far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key forms -- the first is that we have to instill trust in its own body.
We have to help our teenagers to develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very impressed by when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs don't realize it, to get the situation.
So, we have to make sure that the program that our kids follow is not only having a positive impact, but also a <unk> impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas. The first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are starting to work for anyone willing to provide an education in your body self-esteem that works.
An education is a <unk> but facing this problem requires each of us to take the reins in the issue and be a better model for women and girls in our own lives.
I challenging the status of the current status of how women are seen, and I mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to tell with the contribution of our politicians in <unk> or the size of its <unk> or <unk> that determination or success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start judge people so they are, not as you see.
We can actually start by doing it by assuming by the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can tell people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you, when was the last time you would get a <unk>
In short, we need to work together as communities, as governments and as businesses, to truly change our culture, so that our children will grow their entire person, valuing the individuality, the <unk>
We need to put people who really make a difference in a <unk>
It makes a difference in the real world, let's make them be the ones that come out on the big screen because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they think they see that they are never going to be able to be the ones that are who they are, or to achieve what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who are you in mind?
<unk>
<unk>
<unk>
Her <unk> A <unk>
It might be simply the woman who is at two feet away. What would it mean for her if he was released from that voice <unk> in his interior, he would tell him for not having long legs -- <unk> more <unk> a smaller <unk> <unk>
What would it mean for her if we were doing this, and we would be able to unlock his potential for that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the images are <unk> to everyone.
But let's take our children the truth.
You know, the way that you see you is just a part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them for whom they are and because of what they do, and because they make us feel.
They went to self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
Let's change each of us, the way we talk about and matched us with other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the little <unk> of a year of age today, they become safe agents of change insurance agents tomorrow.
So let's do it.
On November five of November 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> entered a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi <unk> <unk> the head of the League of Defense <unk>
To <unk> initially was the innocent and a prisoner of other <unk> in the company of others, started planning on the attacks of about 12 of New York, including <unk> <unk> and the U.N.
Fortunately, those plans was <unk> by an informant of FBI.
Sadly, the pump of 1993 in the World Trade Center, was unable to escape it.
Later on, he would be convicted of their involvement in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being an engineer <unk> with an American <unk> who was an American <unk> who was the two made everything possible to give me a happy childhood child.
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a way of Islam, that very few, including most Muslims get to meet.
By experience I saw that when people take time to interact, don't require a lot to get to wish to want the same stuff in life.
However, in all religion, in every human group, there is always a tiny fraction of people who were <unk> so <unk> to their convictions who thinks that we need to use all the possible media so that everyone lived as them.
A few months before his arrest he sat with me and explained to me that over the last weekends he sat down with me and explained that over the last week, he and some friends, had been going to catch on Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We arrived at the <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When I was <unk> my father helped me hold the <unk> on the shoulder and explained to me how to point to about 30 meters.
That day, with the last bullet I shot at the little bullet that gave the little orange light over the target and to surprise all of us, especially of me, the whole goal was on fire.
My uncle became the other and in Arabic, he said <unk> <unk>
<unk> such a child.
All of us, the comment was made a lot of laughter. but just a few years later, I understood what they were so funny.
Did you see in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be convicted of putting a little loaded with 700 pounds of explosives in the World Trade tower in the World Trade Center, causing a explosion that killed six people and hurt other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called it <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved me 20 times. That instability in my childhood was not allowed to make a lot of <unk>
Every time I started to feel comfortable close to someone was now from packing and get to another city.
As it was always me the new face of class was often <unk>
<unk> secret to my identity to avoid being the white man, but it will be the new of the quiet class, silent and <unk> it was enough <unk>
So most of the time I was going home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons I didn't have social skills, to say <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I wasn't prepared for the real world.
They <unk> opera judge the people, based on more indicators like their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they put to test my thinking was during the presidential elections of 2000.
In a <unk> program that I participated in the National Convention in Philadelphia in Philadelphia.
My group <unk> in the subject of juvenile violence -- like I had been <unk> most of my life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from various <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the kids we had done friendship, Jewish was.
I took a bunch of days to go out to light this detail and I realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and I was really proud to have to beat the barrier that all life had been made to me believe that he was a <unk>
Another crucial moment came when I got a summer job in the Bush in the Bush <unk>
I found myself with people of all kinds of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental to the development of my character.
The whole life had been taught that the <unk> was a sin and, by extension, all gay people were bad <unk>
By the chance, I had the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the <unk> and less critics that had seen in life.
Having been a child, I developed a sense of empathy towards the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy for me to treat kind of kind, exactly the way I wish to be treated.
So I was able to contrast the stereotypes that they had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know how that is a homosexual but I know what is being judged by something beyond my control.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
Every night, Jon Stewart made me become honest <unk> to my <unk> and I helped see that race of people, religion or sexual orientation, you have nothing to do with character.
In many forms he became my <unk> in a moment when I was desperately <unk>
Sometimes the inspiration can come from the unexpected thing, and that a Jewish comedian had had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> was not in vain.
I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my way to think, and she told me something that conserving my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with the eyes tired of somebody who had suffered enough <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that point, I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all of that hate inside of it.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why did I go out and put myself in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope somebody else is to lead to violence, I can hear my story and to understand that there is a better way to me, that even though I would join this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't get to me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against prejudice.
I do it for the victims of terrorism and their loved ones and their loved pain and the losses that terrorism has produced them in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism talking, against those acts without sense, like rejection of my father's actions.
And with this one, I put up here as proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race. What kids don't have to follow the roads of their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you.
At this point, there's a film that projects in their minds.
It's an incredible movie film.
It's in 3D and it has <unk> sound of what you hear and you see right now, but that's just the beginning.
Your film has <unk> tastes and texture.
You feel your body, your pain, your famine, your pleasure.
It's got emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, like your childhood moments you project to your eyes.
And it has constantly a <unk> voice in your conscious thought.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything online.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of mind and the world.
<unk> is one of the fundamental truths about the existence of the human being.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an inner movie for you, you, you and you.
There's nothing to make them more directly.
At least, I know that I have an <unk>
I have no certainty that you are aware of.
<unk> is the reason to live.
If we were not aware of, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time is the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these films <unk>
Why are we not just robots that we have to get to produce outcomes without experiencing the movie <unk>
At this point, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate awareness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible to be a science of consciousness.
Science by nature, is objective of.
<unk> by nature, is subjective things.
So there may never be a science of consciousness.
Because for most of the 20th century, you know, that vision.
The psychology is studying behavioral behavior, the neuroscience is the <unk> brain, but never mentioned consciousness.
And even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> as Francis Crick and physicists as Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the moment for science to perform the <unk>
And since then, there was a true bang, a flowering of the scientific work of consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of consciousness in the recent years of consciousness in recent years was the pursuit of correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw something about this kind of fantastic work that I presented Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
We now understand much better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feel happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences, but we don't know why.
I would like to explain that this kind of work of neuroscience is answers some questions that we want to explain consciousness. The questions about what certain areas of the brain are and what they would like.
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
No offense to <unk>
In reality, there's no easy problem with consciousness.
It doesn't address the real mystery of this <unk> Why all physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there an internal <unk>
At this moment, we can't do it.
And you can say, let's give a few years to the neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon like <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical <unk> are all cases of emerging behaviors, how they operate <unk> how they work, how they're <unk> how they are <unk> and <unk> the living organisms are all questions about the target function.
That could be apply to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how we speak, how we speak, how we play <unk> -- all of them are questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, questions about behavior is between easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question why is it all is accompanied by an immune experience.
And here is, the standard paradigm of the <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually still doesn't have a lot to say.
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk>
I want a scientific theory of <unk> that work for a long time, I would hit my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure terms that would work.
But at the end I came to the conclusion that that didn't work for reasons for <unk>
I think we're going to stay at this point.
We have a wonderful <unk> chain, great. We get used to this; the physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, explains biology, explains part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit in this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
On the other, we don't know how to put that idea to our scientific view of the world.
I think that the consciousness, right now, is a kind of <unk> something that we need to integrate our worldview, but we don't know even how.
With an anomaly like radical ideas, you can need to need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that were very upset about being able to deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There's some possibilities for crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, he's here today, has one.
The crazy idea is that there is no such problem in consciousness.
The whole idea of the subjective subjective movie includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
Actually, what we need to do, is to explain the functions -- the behaviors of the brain, and so it studies everything that needs to explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of pure consciousness, <unk> <unk>
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to simply deny that the observation of consciousness is satisfying.
But I go in a different direction.
In the time, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
<unk> sometimes take some aspects of the universe like <unk> space, space and mass.
It creates fundamental laws that <unk> like laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties don't tell us in terms of anything more fundamental.
Rather, they considered fundamental principles, and there is built the world.
Sometimes, the list of the fundamental is <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> discovered that you can't explain the electromagnetic phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts -- space, time, mass <unk> -- <unk> -- the basic laws of <unk> and he <unk> the basic electric charge as a fundamental concept that those laws <unk>
I think that's the situation that we find with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- space, space, mass, mass, mass, then for logic, is there to <unk>
The most natural thing would be <unk> the same as a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that it's suddenly not the object of science.
It opens the path to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect our consciousness with other fundamental concepts -- space, the time, the physical <unk>
The physicists sometimes say that we want the fundamental rules that we could get them into a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find such simple laws that we could put them into a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we need.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This is sometimes called <unk> <unk> by everyone, <unk> by mind, every system is conscious, not only humans, dogs, mice, flies, even the microbes of Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be filled with distress when you think -- always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But the thought is that maybe photons can have some element of crude feeling that will be some <unk> precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little bit crazy for you.
How would anybody think that <unk>
And part of this comes from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's <unk> like space, time and mass, is natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that although the idea seems to us, it's much less for people in different cultures, where the human mind seems to be more a continuum with nature.
A deeper reason it comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful form of finding rules that we can address the thinking with the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
Whenever there are information processing.
<unk> of complex <unk> as in a human being, very complex awareness.
<unk> of simple, simple awareness.
And the very exciting thing is that in the recent years a neuroscientist, <unk> neuroscientist, took this kind of theory and developed <unk> by mathematicians.
It has a mathematical measure of information, which calls <unk> which measures the level of information integrated into a system.
And it's supposed to be about consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of integration of information, a high degree of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a measure of information integration, just as significant as important as important awareness.
But when you get to the worms, microbes, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The <unk> level of information is smaller, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a different level of consciousness from zero.
It actually brings a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate awareness to the physical world.
The physicists and philosophers have often looked at physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but we don't talk about the reality underlying the reality behind the bottom.
As it explains Stephen Hawking, "Where is the fire of the <unk>
From the <unk> vision, the equations of physics can be left as they are, but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, the consciousness is that he puts fire at equations.
In that vision, consciousness doesn't find out of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there in the center.
This vision, I think, <unk> vision has the potential to <unk> our relationship to nature, and it can have social and ethical and ethical consequences.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I shouldn't eat anything that had consciousness, then I should be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll get a lot hungry.
I think this tends to do well, this tends to transform your <unk> whereas what matters in ethical terms and moral <unk> is not both the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness on other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system from Samantha <unk> <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of information -- she has an integrated information processing so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, they have very serious ethical problems about the ethics of development systems of intelligent computers and the ethical ethic.
Finally, you can ask for the consciousness of collective <unk> the planet.
Canada has their own consciousness?
Or a more local level, an integrated group, like the audience at a TED Talk, at this point, we have a collective consciousness, a TED movie for this whole group of TED -- different from the movies in each of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least it's a question you should take to be serious.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's correct.
I'm actually more sure the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing, which is a fundamental thing that is universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, many challenges, like, how do those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex awareness that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going through the right path to a serious awareness.
If not, well, this is probably the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve that overnight.
But I think we finally will go to discover.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village all Victoria.
He had a very normal profile.
I went to school, my friends, my friends, I would love with my younger sisters.
Everything was very normal.
And when I was 15, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to <unk> for a community prize.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there is a problem yet.
She didn't actually get anything."  And she was right.
I went to school, I had good grades. After the school, I had a low profile on my mother's <unk> and spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yeah, I know. What contradiction.
But they were right.
I did nothing that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered as a achievement.
Years later, I was in the second part of teaching in a high school school in <unk> just after 20 minutes in the class of 11 studies, a boy raised his hand and said, "Hey, when you give your <unk>
And I said, "What is it?"
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for a good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> speech.
When people on chairs from wheels, they talk about things like <unk> in school?"
Usually in <unk> hall.
And it was then when I realized, this kid had had experiences with disabled people as physical objects.
And we don't know it, and it's not from the boy, I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people. We're there to inspire.
And in fact, I'm on this stage <unk> what I do in this wheelchair, and you probably are waiting for you to tell you. Right?
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid.
I'm not here to <unk>
I'm here to tell you that they were lied to us in relation to disability.
Yes, they have been sold to us the lie that disability is something <unk> A capital <unk>
It's something wrong and live with a disability to do a phenomenal thing.
It's not something wrong and it doesn't make you <unk>
And over the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> "Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a huge amount of them.
You may have seen one of the little girl without drawing with a pencil <unk>
You may have seen a child running with carbon fiber legs.
And there are a lot of these pictures, which are what we call inspiration, <unk>
And I use the term porn term <unk> because we would bring a group of people to the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we tend to have disabilities in the benefit of people without disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so that we can see them and think, "Well, thank you very bad that my life could be worse.
I could be that person."
But if you're that person?
I've lost the account of the number of times that I've been talking to me strange <unk> to express that they believe that I'm a brave or a source of inspiration, and this was happening before my work had a public profile.
It was as if I stood up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, these images are going to be inspired by people with disability in the benefit of people without disability.
They're there so you can see them and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put your concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a tough thing.
So some things.
But the things that we suffer are not the things that you might think.
They're not relative things to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I was called the social model of the <unk> which tells us that we are more disabled, because of the society we live in that because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm really excited about it.
The things I need to do, and I've learned to get the best of your ability as well as you do, and that's what happens with children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything out of the commons.
They're simply using their bodies taking the best of their ability.
So it's really just going to happen in the way we do that, to share those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it says it as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because they've been sold to us this lie that disability makes us quite remarkable.
And honestly, it doesn't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here -- the inspiration, and you think, "My God, you're not sometimes inspired by anything?"
And actually, I know I am.
<unk> from other people with disability at all time.
However, I don't know that I'm lucky enough to do.
<unk> that this is a great idea to use a <unk> <unk> to pick up the things that they fall over.  <unk> the clever trick of how to load the battery battery cell phone on your chair.
Great.
We learn from force and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk>
I really believe that that lie that have been sold to us about disability is the biggest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that it's lie because it's not true, because of the social model of disability.
A bunch of smiles in front of a wall of stairs has never done to become a <unk>
Never.    <unk> on a television screen will not come up with the <unk> for people who are <unk>
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to convert all those books to the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15 year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> doesn't consider it not to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have as low expectations of people with disability that we are <unk> to get up of bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement.
The disability doesn't make us <unk> but question what you think you think about it.
Thank you.
What do you have to do the augmented reality and soccer <unk> with the <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> without <unk>
Unfortunately, today just answering one of those questions, so you know, please, not <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think of <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but augmented reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to learn, because the augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and the mobile phones.
So how do we get to reality <unk>
The first step, is what I wear <unk> the Google <unk>
I'm sure many are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google <unk> are a device that allows them to see what I see.
It will allow you to experience what is a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you would relate to your imagination.
We can use the Google Glass, underneath a helmet and knowing what is running through the game field to 160 <unk> the blood hitting the ears.
We can know that it feels like a man of 110 pounds -- we were trying to <unk> with all his self.
I've been there and I assure you, it's not nice.
I would show some videos to show you what is using Google <unk> under the helmet, and give you an idea of that.
Unfortunately, it's not images of <unk> practices because the idea of the <unk> of emerging technology is a submarine up to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
So a moment. It would take a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is being <unk> in the football field, from the perspective of the <unk>
You may have noticed the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> from Washington University.
<unk> Mice <unk> mice.
Blue eight, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more like to be in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
You guys want that experience.
You know, you want to be in the field, be your favorite players and have asked me on YouTube and <unk> <unk> you can see from the angle of a field of <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we go to <unk> how we got it to the next <unk>
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> which is surely many of you already know.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the most realistic virtual reality apparatus ever created, and it's not cheap.
And I'm going to show you why, with this video.
Man: Oh, gosh.
No, no, no! I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh, my God! Ah!
<unk> That's the experience of a man on a roller coaster <unk>
What will be the experience of a fan when we <unk> a video from Adrian <unk> across the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before running and make a <unk> What will be the experience of a fan of a fan.
When I can be <unk> running through the <unk> releasing the ball at the bottom of the network?
What will be your experience when you go from a mountain to over 100 miles as a <unk> <unk>
Maybe you would get the sales for adults.
But this is not really <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we achieve reality <unk>
<unk> reality -- <unk> reality when <unk> and owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. It gives you money.
So, here's a quick refresher on technology in <unk>
In 1965, the Baltimore <unk> put him on a <unk> to his field <unk> so it would play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> placed <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> and then in the <unk>
They had more viewers because it was faster, more entertaining.
In <unk> imagine that they're a player coming back to your group, and you see your next place shown in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that they carry on in front of you, you don't have to worry about to forget a <unk>
Or you <unk> the strategy.
Just go out into the field and <unk>
And the coaches want them because they don't follow their instructions, they lose parties, they hate to lose games.
If you lose parties like a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a manual of <unk> strategies.
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your way to play the game.
How would you do it?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera in every corner of the stadium having a view from the high of the people who are down.
You can also get information from the <unk> and the <unk> something that's already working on.
And all of that information is sent to your players.
The good teams will know <unk>
Bad people will have information <unk>
This is going to give good people of the bad equipment.
So, your computer equipment will be as important as your <unk> and data analysis to stop being just for nerds.
It'll be also for <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the country?
Imagine that it's the <unk>
You get the ball and it <unk>
Let's go to an open receptor -- all of a sudden, a <unk> on the left side of your bombsight -- you get a defense behind you is going to <unk> Usually not <unk> but the <unk> system.
It will be <unk> to the protection.
Another <unk> you get a open receptor here.
<unk> <unk> but <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land, but the receptor sees in its bombsight an area of grass that lights up and can modify your career.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> running and <unk>
The public <unk> and the fans have followed the play from every angle.
This is something that creates massive emotion in the game.
So I'm going to do lots of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
The fans want to be in the field.
Do you want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of sports because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality <unk>
We're going to use it just as a piece of bread and <unk>
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster empathy between human beings, to show someone how it is, literally, to be in the other person's place.
We know what this technology is worth for <unk>
It generates billions of income a year.
But how much this technology does for a teacher in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad their actions are from <unk> perspective.
How much does this technology mean for gay people in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how it lives to be <unk>
How much is it worth a <unk> or an Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more in space and science instead of <unk> notes and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality is coming.
The questions that we do, the decisions we take and the challenges we face, <unk> as usual.
Thank you.
I recently told me after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years ago, I spent the end of the southern end of the Lofa County, which includes the Golden <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure, known to its beautiful view of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean -- and their architectural <unk>
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate bridge was opened in <unk>
Joseph <unk> social engineer to build the bridge said that, "The bridge is pretty much <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not practical and <unk>
But from its more openness, they have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some people believe that traveling between the two towers will take another <unk> this bridge has been <unk> as such, as each of us from it frees you from all your concerns and pain, and the waters that pass under your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used for committing suicide.
After one every free four to five seconds, the body hits roughly 120 miles an hour.
The impact <unk> the bones, some of which we have vital organs.
Most of us die in the impact.
The ones that no, normally they fall into the water <unk> and then they <unk>
I don't think that the <unk> of the suicide method is realizing the death of the death of the death that they <unk>
This is the wire.
Except about the two towers, there are 32 inches in parallel to the bridge.
This is where most people are in order before they get their life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and in its darkest time, it's very difficult to bring it back.
I took this picture last year while this young man talked with a officer looking at his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had success that day to bring it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any formal training.
So let's try to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who <unk> suicide, as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, skilled veterans and psychologists train the new official ones.
This is Jason <unk>
I met this about 22 <unk> last year to receiving a call of a <unk> <unk> <unk> sitting on the cord near the center.
<unk> and when I got there, I looked at Jason talking with an official <unk> Bridge <unk>
Jason was only 32 years old and flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, I had flown down here two times before from New Jersey to try to kill you from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> we asked if we knew if we knew the story of the box of <unk>
<unk> the mythology <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent the Earth to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could more than <unk> and she opened the box.
She came out of <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against man.
The only thing good in the box was hope.
So I said, "What happens if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped about <unk> leaned on the right, and it did.
This kind of clever boy in New Jersey had just taken their life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the rabbi rabbi called me to see what he was.
The parents of Jason had <unk>
<unk> damage to a lot of people.
I pose these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or somebody loved it <unk>
What do you find?
Can you say?
In my experience, you don't just have to talk, but you need to listen.
Listening to understand.
Don't <unk> <unk> or say to the person you know how it feels like because they probably won't.
I just stand there, you can be the tipping point that you need.
If you think somebody is <unk> you're not going to be afraid of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask you the question is: <unk> in similar circumstances have been thinking about finishing their life, you've had these <unk>
<unk> the person in front can save the life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible and that they never go to <unk> <unk> believe that there is nothing you can do to <unk> social isolation, and a lost interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read you your letter.
She lost his son the 19th of January of this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days ago, and he's on his permission and blessing I read the read.
"Hello, <unk> I imagine you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go up to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you for a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends who tell their friends, etc.
I'm still pretty <unk> but noticing more moments to realize that Mike didn't go home.
Mike was driving back to San Francisco to see the party of 49 <unk> with his father the 19 of January.
It never came there.
I called the police of <unk> and <unk> it as disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officers came to my house and reported that the car of Mike was down in the bridge.
A witness I had seen it jumping up from the bridge to the <unk> of the afternoon before.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who has not been before without having a real mental disease.
It shouldn't be so easy to end with it.
My sentences are with you for your fight.
The <unk> the Golden Gate Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and walk the way his son took that day, and also the value to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean for hope and value.
On March of March 2005, I contacted a radio call by a <unk> <unk> subject on the sidewalk bridge near the northern tower.
I took my knee on the sidewalk and looked at this man, Kevin <unk> on the sidewalk.
When he looked at me, she immediately crossed the <unk> and stopped at that little tube that goes around the tower.
During the time and the next half hour, I heard as Kevin talked about his depression and despair.
Kevin decided by his mind that day to go back to that lane and give it to life another opportunity.
When Kevin came back, I got it.
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What was what he did that he made it <unk> and gave him the hope and life another <unk>
And you know what she told me?
He said, "I <unk>
You stopped talking and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to <unk>
"Dear Lord <unk> Nothing erase the 11th of the 11th of March, and you're one of the reasons that Kevin is still with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness that has been properly <unk>
I was introduced to Kevin when I only had six months, completely unconscious from all of those traits -- but thank God, now we know.
Kevin is in order, as he said.
We give God for you.
I totally debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end she writing, <unk> <unk> When I visited San Francisco Children's <unk> that night, you <unk> like the patient.
I knew I did have it to <unk>
Kevin is a <unk> father and a member of the society.
Talk openly about the events of that day and of his depression with the hope that his story inspiring others.
Prisoners is not just something I have found in the work.
It's personal.
My grandfather was <unk> with poison.
That act, despite the end of its own pain, theft.
This is what suicide.
For most people <unk> or those who think suicide would not think of hurt another person.
You just want your own pain to be <unk>
Usually this is just about three things: to sleep, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illnesses and suicide calls around the bridge.
From those incidents I've been directly involved, I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who talked about about an hour.
During that time, I got back for three times.
In the end, I looked at me, and he said, "I am sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely awful.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of people that we get to contact on that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, those few who have jumped from the bridge and lived and that you can talk about it, that one or two percent, most of those people have said that the <unk> who leave the railing realized that they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I say to people, the bridge doesn't just connect to <unk> in San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or the bridge that we do is something that everyone and every one of us should be working on to do.
suicide can prevent.
There's hope. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you're not from, but in your interior you know what you are, and a question will you tell you, how do you tell you about that?
I have to be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone in any way I'm alone.
When I became a model I felt that eventually I had been able to have had since a little girl.
My outside my outside finally <unk> my inner truth with my inner self.
So for the very reasons, the ones that I'm going over later -- when I look at this picture, I think, I think, <unk> <unk> <unk>
But last October, I discovered that I'm just getting started.
We will all love our families, our religion, our society, our moment in history, even our bodies.
Some of you have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of the skin and the beliefs of the skin or the beliefs of us.
They're people who always defy the status quo, what is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors, a lot of my friends, a even ignored my story.
I think this mystery is called epiphany.
This is my own.
I stood up as a <unk> when I was born because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I always had this t-shirt in the head.
And my mom was going, "Why are you always carrying that t-shirt into the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I'm a <unk>
I knew then how to <unk>
The gender has always been considered <unk> but now we know that, really, is a more complex and mystery thing.
Because of my success, I never loved to share my story, not because he thought that I'm bad, but for how the world comes to those of us who want to <unk>
Every day, I appreciate a woman.
I have mom, Dad and a family who beat me as I am.
Many are not so fortunate.
There's a long tradition in <unk> culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a <unk> goddess of the <unk>
And when I was eight, I was in a party in the Philippines who celebrated these puzzles.
I was in front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman appeared in front of me, and I remember that moment as if something happened to me, this is the kind of woman I would like to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I was still wearing a man, I met this woman called <unk>
It's the director of a beauty of beauty.
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you been involved in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if she <unk> she was over <unk> and <unk> and that night, I won in the bathroom, I won <unk> I won in <unk> and he was <unk> in the <unk> of over 40 candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not a lot of people can say their first job was the queen of beauty of beauty of <unk> but I can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when I went to the remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001 my mom. My mom.
I was shocked.
I told my mother, "Mommy, am I <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen queen to me.
But then, two weeks later, he called me and said, "You know if you beat the United States <unk> you can change the name and your identity <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested I was two <unk> to my name.
She was also accompanied by me when I was standing in Thailand at age 19.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities of Thailand -- to do the most sophisticated surgeries sophisticated surgeries and secure.
At that time, in the U.S., it was necessary to be done before the name and gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at a driving license with the name of <unk> and the <unk> of gender <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity paper means being able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was a license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly my fears saw <unk>
I felt I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and being a model.
Many are not so fortunate.
I think of this woman, <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York City who had lived his truth, but that <unk> put his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All 20 November, we make a global vigil for <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage thanks to a long history of people who were going to <unk> and stood up to injustice.
These are Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my truth alone and only for me.
I want to do the best to help the others to live their truth without shame, not fear.
I'm here, <unk> for some day no longer than 20 percent of <unk>
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
Do you know?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Right. <unk> first, thank you all my <unk>
To my network of support, my parents especially, my family, which is very strong.
I remember all the times that I've been to young people who have been <unk> and sometimes when they called me and told me that her parents couldn't embrace it, I would take the phone, he called my mom and said, "Mommy, can you call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked, other no. It's just gender identity -- that's what is in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we all assigned a gender at birth, and what I try to do is put on the table -- the theme that sometimes that task doesn't block and should have a space that would allow people to <unk> and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be room for curiosity and ask questions, and I hope all of you are my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very enjoyable. <unk> Thank you.
In many societies, and tribal societies, the parents are generally known for their children, but I'm one of the few parents who know her for his daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign by defending his rights in 2007. And when she was <unk> his efforts in 2011, to <unk> the National Prize <unk> was made very <unk> a very popular girl in her country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you look at the history of mankind, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of inequality, of violence and exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies right from the beginning, when at birth a girl, his birth will not be saved.
It's not coincidentally, nor for his father, nor for your mother.
The neighborhood goes, it gives her <unk> to the mother and no one <unk> the father.
And a mother was very excited about having a child.
When you give birth to the first child, the first child, you get sad.
When it gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and with the hope of a son, when she <unk> his third daughter, she feels guilty like a criminal.
Not only stem mother, but the daughter, <unk> daughter when it grows, he suffers from too.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, it stays at home and the school admits of her brothers.
Up until the age of 12 years, it has a good life.
You can <unk>
It can play with your friends on the street, and he can move through the streets as a butterfly.
But when you go into adolescence, when you go to 13 years old, you let it go out of his house without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of his house.
It's not a free person.
It becomes the honor of his father and her brothers and their brothers and their family and her family, and if you put the code of that of course honor, you could even kill.
And it's interesting that this of the honor of honor, it doesn't just affect the life of a <unk> it also affects the lives of the male members of the family.
So this brother <unk> the joys of their life and the happiness of their sisters in the name of the honor.
And there's a more rule of <unk> societies called <unk>
It's supposed to be very good and very <unk> very <unk>
It's the judgment.
The model of a good girl should be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and embracing people's decisions and their mother and people's decisions even if they don't will.
If you put it with a man who doesn't like or if you put it with an old man -- she has to be <unk> because it doesn't want to be <unk>
If I was very young, you have to embrace it.
Otherwise, the <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In words of a <unk> "The <unk> and then gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson from <unk> to his daughter and the same lesson from honor to his children.
And this vicious cycle continues and continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when they were born <unk> and for the first time, believe me, I don't like newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and looked at his eyes, believe me, incredibly <unk>
And so much before I came up, I thought of his name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> de <unk> and I called my daughter so on.
But when I was <unk> all of them were men, and I grabbed my pen, and I grabbed a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she grew, when she was four and a half years old and a half years in my school.
So you might wonder, why should I mention a little girl in a school?
Yes, I have to <unk>
You can give it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in tribal societies, it's a great event for a child's life.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of his identity and his name.
One classroom at school means that it's entered the world of dreams and the aspirations where it can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks before, when they <unk> the form of injuries, Canadian and it was in the relative part of the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason was that I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was why I value my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters or his daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate intelligence and <unk> of my daughter.
The <unk> to sit with me when my friends came to me.
The encouraged to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to lie on their personality.
And this was not just for her, just to <unk>
I've got all these good values in my school to girls and boys in the same way.
I used education for <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught students to forget the lesson of the <unk>
I taught students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found ourselves with a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
He was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of women in all of political, economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
girls are banned to go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to markets.
The musicians were <unk> girls and the singers were <unk>
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and I was scary to get around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really terrifying.
At 10 years, <unk> got up and got up by the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the BBC, blog and offered her same for the New York Times documentaries and I talked about every platform that he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It's <unk> as a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason that the Taliban couldn't tolerate their campaign and the nine in October 2012, he was shot at <unk> in the head.
It was a <unk> day for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, I read her to the ear of my wife -- "I've got <unk> for what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And he said, "Please do not <unk>
<unk> the fair cause.
<unk> your life in play for the cause of peace, because of the cause of education, and the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and you get <unk>
Both were on the right path and God <unk>
These few words are going to be a lot to me, and I didn't ask again.
When <unk> was in the hospital and had severe migraine pains, because his facial nerve -- because his facial nerve was cut down, I used to see a dark shadow that was going on for my wife's face.
But my daughter would never meet.
I used to say, "I'm okay with my smile, and with my face.
I'm going to give you good. Please not be <unk>
It was a comfort for us, and we <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, have learned from her how to resist the most difficult moments and I'm happy to share with you that despite being an icon for women's rights and women and women, is like any 16 <unk>
<unk> when you don't just have his task.
You fight her siblings, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What is special in my <unk> who has made so bold to <unk> so brave and expressive and <unk>
I tell you, I don't ask me what I did.
<unk> I didn't.
I didn't cut your wings, and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain 18 years ago, and since that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion for me.
I'm engineering engineering.
And I want to tell you that I recently joined the Google Map, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> of Google <unk> but all the work that I'll talk about today about the science of the brain, I did before I join Google or outside my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you give you to a brain operation.
You are still as smart or not?
It's not going to be like this, you might be smart.
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't a gray, but it was the dead part of the middle of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much to take, from more than a dozen powerful chemicals every day, because if they didn't take anything, they would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about the combinations and mix of chemicals, and trying to get them to keep alive.
Over once I have saved me.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided that I was going to be able to get the <unk> <unk> because there is really no map of how to say it in <unk>
I started to try with a different <unk> and I was amazed at how small little changes in the doses of the doses of my life -- my sense of who I was, my sense of thinking, my behavior with others.
A particularly controversial case, for a few months, I was starting doses and ordinary chemicals for a twentieth man, and I was surprised to see how my thoughts.
I was always thinking, I thought all the time on sex, and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and --  -- of course, a lot of times in the past I've met various types of guys -- or maybe some versions.
It turned out as an extreme.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was actually <unk> a little bit <unk> to fix a problem that I had on the front, and it just didn't happen.
So I couldn't handle it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation of men and what they have to be able to do -- since then I have better for men.
What I was trying to do is to <unk> those hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth, was to regain my intelligence after the disease and <unk> my creative thinking of ideas.
<unk> thinking almost always in images, and that became my key <unk> how I get those mental images that I can use to create <unk> my ideas, if you were able to create new ideas and <unk> situations.
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> saw things like this.
They thought the images and mental ideas were the same thing.
Now there are people who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how the brain works, for me is very simple: for most of us, the mental imagery are fundamental to <unk> thinking.
So, after several years, I got to find the point right and I have a lot of great mental <unk> really <unk> very sophisticated and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to take very quickly these mental images, from my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a conductor conductor was able to use their imagination just to drive the world to the world?
Or if a musician could extract the music of his head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, like the way that creative people can get to share at the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to do this is simply increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to coming to this with two recent experiments that we did by two groups leading up in neuroscience.
And they both used MRI technology, MRI imaging scan to represent the brain. Here you can see the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and their colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scanning of the brain of a person who looks at an image.
The center of the middle shows the scanning of the brain of that same individual while they were <unk> seeing that same image.
The column on the right was created by the contents of the central column on the left. It looks like the difference is <unk>
This is repeating in many different individuals with lots of different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing an image and imagine seeing that same image is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from the lab at Jack <unk> in Berkeley, California.
They managed to turn brain waves into visual fields.
Let's put it in this way.
In this experiment, it showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos as they <unk> their brains to create a big pool of feedback from the brain to the video sequences.
And then they showed them a film with new images, new animals, and as long as they were <unk> a new <unk>
The computer, using only the brain information scanning it to show what seemed like the person was looking at.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video I showed you.
This blew us off.
We're right next to do that.
We just need to improve resolution.
And now, remember that when you see an image and when you imagine that same picture, you think of the brain the same <unk>
This led to the world's largest brain systems available today, and their resolution was increased as a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution about a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do you get it?
There are a lot of techniques to do that.
One is opening up the skull and introduce electrodes.
I don't offer that one.
A lot of people are proposing new techniques projection from images, even by me, <unk> with the recent outcome in the MRI -- first of us -- we must first ask the next, this technology will be the end of the <unk>
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get higher resolution is with bigger magnets -- but at this point, magnets more <unk> only give small improvements in the resolution, not gains for thousands as we need.
I propose this idea: rather than larger magnets make better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different arrangements -- like making a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a lot of effort in MRI are to make magnets really big, right?
But most of the recent advances in the <unk> of ingenious and brilliant and bright and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> channels in MRI systems.
At the time, instead of a magnetic field -- they will make magnetic patterns -- structured patterns -- to the radio frequencies <unk>
So when we combine the magnetic patterns with the patterns of <unk> radio frequencies -- we can actually increase the data massive that you can get into a single <unk>
Also, we can then split into layers of our growing knowledge over the structure of the brain and the memory to create the increase in the thousands that we need.
By using <unk> we should be able to measure not just the fluid fluid, but the <unk> hormones that I mentioned and perhaps even neural neural activity -- this is sleep.
Will we be able to put our ideas into direct media to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could move above language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn how to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are great questions.
It would be irresistible to use it as a tool to amplify our thinking and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the <unk> cure and similar diseases.
We have a few choices more than opening up this door.
But anyway, choose a year to happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that it will take much more.
We need to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay closet.
I think we all have <unk>
Your closet probably will be telling you to tell some person for the first time that he loves or tell someone you're pregnant, or tell someone you have cancer, or any other hard conversation that you have ever done in life.
So all I closet is a hard conversation, and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of I've lived and have come out of that closet.
It's afraid, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
Many years ago, I worked in the South Side <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and being there, I had to go through several stages of the intensity of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my armpits, quote the letters of <unk> gave <unk> as a <unk>
And I'm going to be slope from the <unk> of my short <unk> and I had my head <unk> I would ask you usually a child, "Hey, you're a guy or <unk>
And it would appear for physical silence at the table.
I took my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee a little bit, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother tossed a cold, look at his son.
But I would say nothing, and I went on inside.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised that next time I would say something.
So that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A family silence, but this time I was <unk> and I was about to get into the female issues at the table --  I had the <unk> of Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Even a fragment of the "Vagina Monologues," I <unk>
So I would take a breath down and I went down and I went down and look at my backs and a little girl with a rose <unk> looking at what is not a challenge for an <unk> <unk> just a girl with a question: "You are <unk> or <unk>
So I would take a breath again, again, I stood up near her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is something complicated.
I have the short hair like the one child, and I saw her clothes, and you know, I am a girl, and you know, as you like to use a pink, and sometimes you like to use a comfortable <unk>
Now, I'm more than a girl of a <unk>
And that girl looked at me <unk> and he said, "My favorite ninja is <unk> and he has a fish.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was all about it. "Oh, no, you're a girl.
What about the <unk> that <unk>
It was the easiest conversation that I ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl in the <unk> and I, both of them were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside the dark, you can't know what color is the walls.
You just know how one feels like living in a closet.
That's like my closet is not different from yours or yours or yours.
I'm going to give you a hundred reasons for why to go out of my closet that was harder than coming out of his, but this is the <unk> It's hard not to <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me that explaining to somebody who declared online <unk> it's harder than to say it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story is harder to say to your five-year-old son that are going to be <unk>
There's no more difficult, there's only the hard thing.
We need to stop classifying what we need to do with respect to another person to make us feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we need to just feel empathy because we all live a tough thing.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make them feel security, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what your walls are made of your walls, a closet not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine 20 years ago.
I, which had a horse <unk> a dress and <unk> shoes.
It wasn't the militant lesbian prepared to fight for any child in four who would fit in the coffee.
I was frozen for fear, <unk> in a corner of my dark closet.
My family, my whole friends that I have spent my entire life trying to not <unk> and now the world was turning around purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we all have followed for so long, but if you don't toss that <unk> you kill you.
One of my <unk> launches was on my sister's wedding.
It was the first time that many people guests knew was gay, and by doing my <unk> <unk> in my <unk> <unk> in my black dress and <unk> walked around the tables and finally came to one where the friends of my parents, people I knew I was years ago.
And after talking a moment, one of the women shouted, <unk> to Nathan <unk>
And the gay story had begun.
Have you ever been in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is, we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard it's <unk>
You know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
So what is your favorite TV show.
Our favorite <unk> Will <unk>
And you know who <unk> us.
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but in hopes of desperately trying to show her support, to get me to know that I was on my side, finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses shirts <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that moment, like you have all the <unk> <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very hard to find them and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, but <unk>
If you're authentic with someone, you have to be prepared for the real thing that you do.
That's how hard conversations are still not my strong point.
Ask for anybody who I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I still like to call the three principles of <unk>
Now, please look at this through the gay perspective, but understand that what it means to go out of any closet is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be real.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in the coffee had no armor but I was ready for battle.
If you want someone to be <unk> the others must know that we do we do suffer.
Number two: Be direct <unk> Just <unk> <unk> your <unk>
If you know they're gay, <unk>
If they say to their parents that maybe they might be gay, they will maintain the hope that that could change.
They don't give you a sense of fake hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex.
You communicate the truth.
It would never be done by that.
And some of you can go out safe hurt -- so they have done, but I'm never sorry for what they are.
And yes, maybe some of you will feel <unk> but that's something in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not from you.
The only story that matters is what you want to write.
So the next time you find out in a dark way, I think, <unk> you must know that we've all been there before.
And they may feel very themselves, but they are.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
What is that?
If you look at the story of what intelligence has been seen by an productive example by <unk> <unk> that "The question of whether a machine can think is as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can be <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a criticism of <unk> of computing as Alan <unk>
And so, a few years ago, I took a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms of intelligence.
So let me step back a step.
We first start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that they're from an alien race that doesn't know anything about the biology of Earth or the Earth or the Earth of the Earth -- but they have incredible telescopes, and you can see the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason is that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from a alien race that doesn't know anything about it, which has no concept about intelligence on Earth, you would see forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how to a certain time in time, the asteroids that <unk> the surface of a <unk> planet, stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question that understanding the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that led to several years ago, I studied a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines, that I think, I think, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there has been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be <unk> adjusted to development of intelligence, and in particular, to develop universal states that are going to create the diversity of possible future.
Finally, in the operating process, there has been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so, taking all these different themes and <unk> together, I said, for several years ago: There is an underlying mechanism for intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's only one equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the equivalent of the closest to an E = <unk> for the intelligence that I have seen.
So what you're seeing here is an affirmation that intelligence is a strength, F, that acts in the end of maximizing the future of action.
It acts to maximize future freedom of action, or keeping the open options with a force T, with the diversity of potential future accessible, Yes, to an imminent time for the future.
In a nutshell, of intelligence doesn't like to stay <unk>
<unk> is trying to maximize future freedom of action and maintain open.
And so, having this equation, is natural to ask: What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
<unk> the level of human intelligence.
<unk> artificial intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, will show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology has suggested that universes that produce more <unk> or <unk> during their life should have more favorable conditions for intelligent beings like us.
But what happens if that <unk> connection between entropy and intelligence is a <unk> relationship.
What if smart behavior is not only correlated with the production of long-term entropy in the long term, but it actually comes directly from it?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of long-term entropy in any system where you find inside.
Amazingly, <unk> was able to spend multiple testing of animal intelligence, play in human games, and even make money <unk> actions, all of it without having any people to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a single foot of <unk> here we see <unk> <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable partly because we never gave it to <unk>
He just decided to balance the <unk>
This ability to balance for <unk> <unk> and human assistance technologies.
This ability of tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
In addition, just like some other animals can cooperate throwing away off the opposite of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can do a version of the model of that task.
This ability to cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning.
<unk> is widely applicable in a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see it successfully playing a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> its potential for play.
So here we see <unk> orchestrate new connections in a social network where the friends are constantly continuously and kept with success on the grid right now.
This can also have applications in health care, energy care, energy and intelligence.
So here we see <unk> organizing the routes of a fleet of ships, discovering with success and using the Panama Canal to expand in the world from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable to problems in defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> will spontaneously discover and run a strategy of <unk> <unk> in a simulated series of <unk> actions, that it successfully increased the assets under its evolutionary management.
This risk of risk management will have broad apps in finance, insurance and safe.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of marks of intelligent cognitive behaviors -- such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation -- all derive from an equation, that leads to a system to maximize its future freedom of action.
Now, here's a profound <unk>
Let's go back to the beginning of the term the term -- the <unk> work -- there was always the concept that if you could see smart machines, there would be a <unk> rebellion, there would be a <unk> rebellion, there would be a <unk> rebellion, there would be a <unk> rebellion, there would be a <unk> rebellion, there would be a <unk> rebellion, there would have been a <unk>
Machines will be transferred against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had all the concept of rebellion <unk> in reverse.
It's not the machines first become smart and then <unk> and trying to take over the world.
It's all wrong that the impulse to take control of all future future is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence, that general intelligence can actually arise out directly from taking control instead of being backwards.
Another important consequence is the search for the target.
They often ask me, how do you find targets to learn from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent to that statement to move to the descendants to help them build artificial artificial artificial artificial intelligence or to help them understand human intelligence, is this: intelligence must be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize future freedom of action and avoid restrictions on their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at a tipping point in human history, something between the emergence of stars and losing the planet we call <unk>
Even over the last few years, we have expanded so much our knowledge to the Earth in the context of the universe.
The Kepler mission has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, which points to the Earth is just one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a Space Telescope.
The data gathered by Kepler shows the sizes of planets besides the distance between them and their parent star.
In together, this helps us understand whether these planets are small and <unk> like planets on our solar system, and also the amount of light that they receive from their <unk>
At the time, this gives clues about whether these planets that we find are kind or not.
Unfortunately, as we are finding this trove of potentially <unk> worlds our own planet is changing under the weight of humanity.
<unk> was the hotter recorded.
<unk> and sea ice that has been with us since millennia, now they're disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused on a global scale have <unk> our ability to disrupt their course.
But I am not a weather scientist, no <unk>
But I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with hope to find places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
I could say that I'm looking for alien opportunities in the green sector.
Now, as someone very interested in search for life in the universe can tell you that the more I look for planets like the Earth, more enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet, and the planets that we know better than our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little bit further from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially livable world shown that by a mission like <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been habitable in the past, and in part, that's why we study so much to Mars.
Our <unk> like <unk> tracks their surface in search for clues about the origins of life as well as we know it.
The satellites that exist as the <unk> mission -- they take samples of the <unk> atmosphere, and they try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
Companies now offer not just short space flights but also the prospect of living on Mars.
But even though all these <unk> images remind us to the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our own imagination with ideas and ideas -- compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that still stay in <unk> places that are really beneficial in comparison to Mars.
Even in the <unk> and most <unk> of the Earth is cool and full of oxygen <unk> by our tropical forests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement for the colonization of Mars and other planets will be able to drag them up with a great and sad <unk> the implication and the belief that Mars will expect in order to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know that it's truly livable the Earth.
For a lot that I like to like the exploration, I'm deep disagree with this idea.
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to accommodate humanity is as imagine that the captain of Titanic will tell us that the real time will be later on in the <unk> <unk>   Thank you.
But the goals for climate exploration, and the preservation is not <unk>
No, they are actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments in our world look like <unk> aliens.
You just find them closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain <unk> spaces in the hostile and land areas of land, maybe we can meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I'll leave you with an experiment -- the paradox of <unk>
A lot of years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi asked me, considering that our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope that there were a lot of planets in this universe, we should have found the evidence of life life until now.
Well, where are they?
Well, one possible solution to the paradox.
It's kind of arrogant to think that only <unk> will save us from ourselves, but the planetary preservation and exploration, <unk> can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to sort of put the hostile environments on Mars for human presence, so we should be able to overcome the even easier task to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I went back my own house.
And while I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see in the window that they were at the dining table where there were <unk>
So quickly I tried to open up all the other doors and windows and they were pretty hot.
I thought about calling a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get to it, and it was cold.
I couldn't go home from my friend of Jeff <unk> because I had a flight early to Europe next to the next morning, and I would get my passport and my suitcase.
<unk> expensive, but sure that they didn't more expensive than a <unk> at night, so I thought, despite the circumstances, I was going to be really stuck.
I'm a <unk> a little bit about how the brain works under <unk>
<unk> <unk> who increases heart rhythm, <unk> levels of adrenaline and <unk> thinking.
And when I got to the counter counter in the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I began to ask myself, if there was something that I could do, systems that I could do in his place, which was going to be able to make things bad things.
Or at least, if bad things happen to happen, which is the chance that it is a total catastrophe for it.
So I started thinking about that, but even a month after my thoughts did not work.
I was having dinner with my colleague, Danny <unk> who was the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed he told him about I broke the window, and I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me who had been practicing something called <unk> retrospective
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written out of this a few years earlier, known as the <unk>
You all know what the <unk> is.
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts come up and try and figure out what it came wrong. Right?
In <unk> as it explains <unk> you look forward and try to figure out all the things that you could go wrong, then you try to figure out what you can do to prevent things out or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk about with you is a few things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious.
In the house, you know, a place for things that are lost easily.
This sounds common and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory works.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to make a track track of the location of things -- where the okay, where the fish, which places where the trees are <unk> where the female tribes are living and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that <unk> in the <unk> in London.
It's the part of the brain that allows the <unk> to find their nuts.
And if you ask if someone really did the experiment, they cut the <unk> sense of <unk> and still they could find his nuts.
They were not using the smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that move too much.
This is the reason for losing your car keys and read it <unk>
So at home <unk> a place for the keys, a hook next to the door, maybe a plate <unk>
For your passport, a particular drawer for you.
For your reading, a particular <unk>
If you go to a place and they're <unk> with that your stuff will always be there when you get them.
What about the <unk>
Take a photo of your credit cards -- a photo of your credit card drive, your drive, your driver's license, your email to be in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> this can facilitate <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, your brain releases this?
<unk> is toxic and <unk> thinking.
So part of <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress we will not be at the best moment, and you need to put systems on the site.
And there are perhaps no more stressful situation that when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we will all be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or one of a loved thing to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all decision-making decisions, and in fact to make financial decisions and social decisions, any kind of decision that we need to take out of the fact that it would benefit from the facts.
So suppose they go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've received the result of the lab and your cholesterol is a bit <unk>
You all know that high cholesterol cholesterol is associated with a higher risk of heart disease, attack the heart injury.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol isn't the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to give you a drug to help reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you've heard about the <unk> and you know that it's one of the most important drugs in the world today. Even you know that you know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there is a question that you should do then, a statistic that is supposed to ask for most physicians don't want to talk about, and companies companies even less.
Is it for <unk> the number needed to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or to have surgery on any medical procedure before you can help a person.
And you should think of what kind of statistical statistic is <unk>
The number has to be one.
My doctor didn't tell me something if it wasn't to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not from the doctor, and if it's somebody's guilt about scientists like me.
We haven't understood very well the <unk>
But the <unk> estimates that 90 percent of the drugs are just about 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number we need to deal with the most widely <unk> <unk> what do you think it is?
How many people have to take it before you can help a person?
300.
This is the research of the cynical researchers who had <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> independently by <unk>
I can explore the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before avoiding a single heart attack, stroke or a <unk> event.
Now you might think, "Well, one chance at 300 of my <unk>
Why do not, <unk> <unk> the recipe for all of us.
But then you have to ask for a more statistical statistic and is, <unk> of the <unk> effects. Yes?
For this particular drug, the side effects are produced by five percent of patients.
And those include things -- <unk> <unk> muscle pain. But they are now think, <unk> five percent is not very likely to happen to me, still take the <unk>
But a moment.
remember that under stress you don't think clearly.
So think of how you can do this with time, so you don't have to make the chain of thinking on the act.
300 people take the pill -- right? A person has <unk> five percent of the 300 have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to go out of the drug to help you the drug.
I don't say they should or not take the <unk>
I just say you have to have this conversation with your physician.
<unk> environmental ethics is part of the beginning of informed consent.
We have right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air for the value of the crash but actually this number that we need to try is pretty typical.
For the surgery that most is done in the older men of 50, <unk> from prostate cancer, the number you need to treat is <unk>
So 49 surgeries for a person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case, produce 50 percent of patients.
Those include helplessness or dysfunction -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you are lucky and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects just <unk> one year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think before the questions that you can argue that we have the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all this on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice many times, you want a more short life to be free of pain, or a longer life that could have a lot of pain towards the end?
These are the things they talk about and think about now, with their family and loved ones.
You can shift from opinion to the heat of the time, but unless you're trained in this kind of thinking.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that it shut down a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
<unk> face with a predator, you don't need the immune system or the <unk> or the immune system, because if your body is spending metabolism on those things, it doesn't react very quickly. You could get the lunch lunch, so none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that you go through the window during those moments of stress is the rational thought, like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown.
So we have to focus on the future to this kind of situations.
I think what's important here is to recognize that we are all <unk>
We're all going to fail then.
The idea is to think about the future how those <unk> could be to put the systems in the place that will help minimize harm, or to prevent the bad things that are happening in the first place.
<unk> the night in <unk> in <unk> when I came back from my journey, my contractor installed a combination of combination along with the door, with a key to the front door, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of letters that I haven't ordered and lots of messages that I haven't seen.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization like a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite <unk>
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to touch more <unk>
Two <unk> even more gentle.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> there you see that it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can be -- I would never go to a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American system, the <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The French signs came during the early 1800s, and over the time of time, they mixed with local signs, and it was developed the language that we now know as a <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> and I was taught to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, I realize it's not true for anything.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, they're really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a sound world, is as if I lived in a foreign country, following the rules of the rules, and <unk> behaviors and rules without <unk>
So how do I understand the sound from?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I've learned for example ...
"Don't <unk> the <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise when you eat the bag of potato <unk>
"Not <unk> and when you're eating, you make sure not <unk> <unk>
This is all called <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think of the sound tag more than the average person does.
I'm super <unk> of sounds.
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound, which is coming next.
From there, this drawing.
By decide.
Let's go on to go on.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see the <unk> has no notes on the lines.
That's because the lines have already contain sounds through subtle and subtle <unk>
In the culture of <unk> the movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the sign to <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, for me, to do this with my thumb that doesn't feel natural.
That's why in my drawings I just have four lines on paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic <unk> there.
Before this time, I had worked as a <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums in different <unk> and as long as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend and that was called me <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now sound has entered my territory of art.
It's going to tell you more about art?
I realized that it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that you don't just experience through the ears.
I can feel it in a way or <unk> or experience that we could even be an idea.
So I decided to reclaim property ownership and <unk> in my art practice.
And everything that had taught me in the sound of sound, I decided to leave and get it.
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was struck by the amount of support and attention I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power, the social currency.
In the bottom of my mind, I always felt that sound was <unk> it was something of a listener.
And the sound is so powerful that it could be <unk> to me and my art work, or I could tell you.
I chose to tell me.
There's a massive culture around speech.
And only because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is as if he didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support just like and become my voice.
So I am able to be relevant in today's society.
So in school, in the work and institutions, work with many different performers of <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
But Ironically, for <unk> their voices, I'm able to maintain a temporary way of value something like taking a loan to a very high rate.
If I will not continue to have this practice, I feel that I could get it into the <unk> and not having any social value.
So, with the sound as my new artistic medium -- <unk> in the world of music.
And I was surprised by seeing the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note can not capture and express fully on the paper.
And the same thing can be told by a concept in <unk>
The two are very space and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect everything as much as the signals like the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, so you understand how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
The <unk> are divided into many different <unk>
If you add a parameter different for each finger as the facial expression, the body movement, the speed, the shape of the body, and the way it hits the piano, the English language is a linear language as if you were <unk> just a key at once.
However, <unk> is more like a chord -- you need the 10 fingers in the way to express a very clear concept or idea in <unk>
If only a key would change the chord -- it would create a completely different meaning.
Same thing happens with music in terms of pitch, <unk> and volume.
In <unk> when we use these different parameters <unk> you can express different ideas.
For example, the signal <unk> in that."
This is the signal <unk> in that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I look at the <unk> through the <unk> lens.
If I had to create a sign and put it over and over and again, it could become like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun comes out and put it in.
This is all that day."
If you get it, and you look at the visually speed, the visually speed, looks like a piece of music.
The whole day.
I feel that the same can be said to <unk> <unk>
"All the <unk>
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how time is expressed in <unk> and how the distance to the body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present gets closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
Then <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very dramatic idea, dramatic at the same time, <unk> one again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a <unk> rhythm of <unk>
However, when I look at the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically at <unk> itself.
Look at <unk> right hand -- <unk> left hand.
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> E, <unk> E, <unk> I'm going to show you a form of the hand called <unk> <unk>
Can you do it with me?
All of them with high hands.
Now we're going to do it both in your head like chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yeah, so well.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and signs around the world.
The second thing I'd like to show you is this. Please do it with me again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in <unk>
Now, third, please, <unk> again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
Let's do three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Now look at how the three signs are very similar. They all occur on your head and the chest. But they transmit meanings very different.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> is alive and wealthy as the music.
However, today, we live in a very small world.
And only because <unk> doesn't have sound, it doesn't have social value.
We need to start questioning what defines social value and allow the <unk> to grow its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe people will understand that we don't have to be deaf, to learn <unk> and they don't have to hear about learning music.
<unk> is a rich treasure.
I'd like to take you to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, they can fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would say, "You can do everything, but then you have to <unk>
Freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination led me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence or a bubble of ignorance -- I mean, because the adults would lie to us to protect us from the horrible truth.
When I got older, I learned that adults also understand, and that they're not very good for clean people from others.
The time is now adult and civil teach and invention in the <unk> of Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait much for my students to walk around the beach <unk> with lots of trash.
So as a good citizens, we cleaned up the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's kind of scary.
And in the last decades, we have been coming out with these big ships and networks, to collect those pieces of plastic to study these pieces of plastic to study them under the microscope, and we <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts at an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very risky and it's also very risky to use those enormous ones.
So along with my students, ages six to 15 years, we dream to invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this <unk> <unk> work so that the kids are very <unk> they can also participate.
And I'll tell you, the kids who manipulate electrical tools feel cool and secure.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect the plastic and we reduce the size we find in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
That's what we do.
I leave it to my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to get them into something that we hope it works.
We decided that instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just information <unk>
Through the use of a robot, we took an image of this <unk> and the kids get very excited about the robots.
Then we started quickly what we call "a <unk>
We're so fast in creating prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we turn light bulbs and web cameras on your knee, and we put it into a floating robot that gets slowly through the water and the plastic we have there, and this is the picture captured by the robot.
We see those pieces of plastic floating through the sensor as the computer on board and that the computer on board process this image and measure the size of each <unk> to get an estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
I took this invention to step on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that somebody else will do it even more.
The cool thing on this project is that students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to fix it immediately.
I'm able to investigate my problem -- but my students in Hong Kong are very <unk>
You see the news, you know, the Internet, the Internet, and you have this truth.
A child, perhaps less than 10 years old, cleaning up an oil spill, just using the hands, in <unk> the largest <unk> forest in Bangladesh.
They were really surprised because this is the water that <unk> it is the water that you get into the water where the water where you live.
You can see also that the water is brown, mud and oil is also brown color and when all <unk> is very hard to see what's in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what is in the water.
We built a first prototype of a <unk> which can be deployed through all kinds of substances that produce <unk> <unk> which can help identify what is in the water.
We put this prototype with a sensor and we send it to Bangladesh.
The cool thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help other children.
I was forced to investigate a problem at <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little further away -- maybe to address a harder problem, and I'm also going to address me.
I'm half Japanese and French and the French and probably remember, in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that it started a bunch of giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> in the coast of Japan.
Over 14 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear power plant in Fukushima, a nuclear headquarters near water.
And today, according to the reports a 300 metric tons is still leaking from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the entire Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the West Coast, we can measure radiation from <unk> everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast and most of the end of the Japanese coast -- and most of the time, it has pretty safe it's blue.
Well, reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year from the crash and research with other scientists, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to lead to children.
Of course not the <unk> the parents don't get it.
But every night you go to the center of the <unk> here you see the use of different masks here.
It could seem like they didn't take work seriously, but they did it because they are going to have to live with the <unk> all of their life.
Together with them we discussed the data <unk> that day and we talk about what we were going to do after, the strategies, the <unk> and so on.
And to do this, we created a bacterial map of the region around the nuclear energy plant.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> pigment to represent real-time data from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
So with this we could notice that the radioactive dust will spread from the top of the mountain into the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was an estimate of <unk>
But based on this organized a civil expedition the closest to the central power to date.
We zoom in to a mile of the nuclear power, and with the <unk> aid of the area we were collecting sediments from the sea bed with a <unk> tracking device as we invented and built.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to an remote problem to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple.
But at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even begun to solve the problems.
I wonder if we should give the leap and try to invent better ways of doing all of these things.
So the classroom became a little bit of a little bit, we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we become the biggest space dedicated to social and environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal, chemistry, a little bit of biology, of optical biology, basically, you can build almost everything there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can actually become with the help of adults, and where adults can be children again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy.
For example.
Or, we can help in the mobility age of advanced age transforming their chairs back into new vehicles in new vehicles.
The plastic, the oil and the <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are the lies.
We can't afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So, scientists, scientists, creators, we need to prepare the next generation to care about environment and people, and so that I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> two cultures of radically opposite design.
One is made out of thousands of steel, the other one thread of silk.
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic one.
One <unk> on the environment, the other thing I thought of.
One is designed by nature, the other one for it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the <unk> <unk> he saw a figure that fights for being free.
The <unk> was only a tool of Michelangelo.
But living creatures are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, cells, we have all the information required it for every cell to work and to <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least from the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by manufacturing and mass production.
The lines of assembly have dictated a world made out of parts, and we would have the imagination of designers and trained architects to think of their objects as <unk> from different functions.
But you don't find <unk> of material <unk> in nature.
Think of human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin <unk>
The skins of the back are <unk>
You just acts as a filter, the other mainly as barrier, and yet, it's the same <unk> there's no parts, no <unk>
It's a system that varies gradually its functionality by variation in <unk>
Here's a split screen that represents my view of the world -- the double personality of every designer and architect to work currently between the <unk> and the gene, between the <unk> and the organism, between assembly and the growth, between the Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the law, analysis, and synthesis, is shown in the two screens after me.
My work, on its most simple level, tries to bring these two visions of the world, moving from assembly and getting to growth.
You probably wonder, why now?
Why wasn't it possible for this 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare moment, where there are four disciplines that offer designers access to tools that we had never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please meet the minds and my hands of my students.
We designed objects, products, products, structures and tools through scaling from scale, large-scale structures like this robotic arm with a reach of 24 meters in diameter with a <unk> basis that is not very far to print <unk> buildings, and graphics <unk> made that glow in the dark.
Here we have <unk> the <unk> a archetype of the ancient Arab architecture, and has created a screen where every aperture is size to shape the form of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> -- this was for a fashion fashion fashion show of Paris with <unk> they're going to be <unk> It's like a second skin made of one piece, <unk> in flexible <unk> around the waist.
Together with a 3D printing <unk> we printed this layer and <unk> 3D <unk> <unk> <unk> and I'll show you more objects like that.
This helmet combines rigid materials and <unk> in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a scanner <unk>
That designers have access to this high-resolution analytical and the instruments -- it allows you to design products that are <unk> not only the way our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed an acoustic chair, a chair to the comfortable structural and also that absorb sound.
Professor <unk> my collaborator, we went back to nature to <unk> and by designing this pattern of <unk> <unk> becomes <unk>
You know, this surface of 44 different properties, which vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> the pressure points in the human body.
Their surface, as in nature, changes its functionality not through the addition of other material or another <unk> but <unk> continuously and <unk>
But is nature <unk>
There are no parts in nature?
I wasn't raised in a religious Jewish home, but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them came out and came to define a lot of what I care about.
As she said, "In the third day of the <unk> God sends the Earth to grow a <unk> tree, <unk>
For that first tree <unk> there would be no difference between trunk, and leaves leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was a piece of fruit.
Instead, the land made trees and <unk> <unk> and flowers.
The Earth created a world made of place.
I often ask myself, "What would design if objects were made of a single <unk>
Let's get a better state of the <unk>
So we look for the material that is going to be the kind of material from the tree to go with fruit and we found it.
The second <unk> most abundant on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons of tons -- each year by organisms, crab, <unk> and <unk>
We thought that if we could tune in its properties, we could generate structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it legal <unk>  We asked a lot of seed husks and we asked the <unk> and produced <unk>
<unk> chemical concentrations have been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from dark, hard and <unk> to the light, soft and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of the material on the march and create these structures made of one single half material around 100 feet recyclable me.
When the pieces are ready, it leaves dry to find a natural form in contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the <unk> process were used for <unk> <unk> which first appeared on the planet 3.5 billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> bacteria designed genetically to capture carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition without problems with <unk> and if it grows even more, to windows.
A <unk> tree, <unk>
Working with an ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and with a little bit of synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure of shrimp husks into an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best <unk> for objects that are designed for <unk> in the sea, <unk> life <unk> and placed on the ground, will help grow a tree.
That fits for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We look for the possibility of creating clothes to keep the life for <unk>
To do that, we have to dominate the bacteria and control their flow.
So as the <unk> board, we made our own table of <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think of synthetic biology as the liquid <unk> only that instead of <unk> metals -- they will fire, new biological yields inside very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
<unk> our own 3D channels.
In our first piece of clothes, it will be <unk> two <unk>
The first is <unk>
She lives in our oceans and in the <unk> of fresh water.
And the second, E. <unk> the bacteria that <unk> in the human intestine.
One turns the light into sugar, the other consumes sugar and produces <unk> biofuels for the built environment.
But these two microorganisms don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship to a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution by design.
To contain these relationships, we have created a single channel that resembles the tract tract -- which will help us to make these bacteria and to <unk> their function of way.
And so we started to grow those channels in the human body, we can see the properties of material according to <unk>
If we wanted more <unk> we had more transparent channels.
This digestive system <unk> when it stretches from one end to another one, 60 meters.
This is half the length of a football field, and 10 times more than our <unk>
And here it is, like <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> channels in life inside your clothing.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are very mild creatures, only half is <unk>
What if design would provide the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that <unk> our skin, <unk> the damaged tissue.
Think of this as a way of edit biology.
I call this the material ecology.
For that, we always have to go back to nature.
And so now, you know that a 3D printer <unk> <unk> material.
You also know that nature doesn't do that.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture -- a home in which they <unk>
<unk> <unk> is about this level of <unk>
It does it through the combination of two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, by connecting those fibers to each other.
And this happens to scales.
The silk worm first turned into the environment, it creates a <unk> structure, and then it starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, manifest themselves in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works, we attach a small magnet to the head of a worm silk <unk>
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of cocoon of the silk worm.
However, when we put the silk worm into a flat road, not within a box, we realized that they <unk> a flat cocoon and still <unk>
So we started to design different parts of them, and we've discovered that shape, the composition, the <unk> structure of <unk> is transmitted directly through the environment.
They often <unk> the silk worms into the death within their <unk> their silk <unk> and it is used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates we can shape <unk> silk without boiling a single <unk>
They were <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we came up with this process to the architectural scale.
We had a robot <unk> doing <unk> silk, and we put it on our site.
We knew that <unk> silk worms to more dark and <unk> areas so we use a solar route to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we created holes or <unk> to block the rays from light and heat, distributing the silk worms over structure.
We were prepared to get the <unk>
We asked <unk> of silk <unk> to a silk farm online.
And then after <unk> four weeks, they were ready to engage with us.
We put them carefully at the bottom of the <unk> and as they were <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and life starts again like us, but much, much more short.
Buckminster Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and I was right.
By combining biological silk about <unk> silk -- they give all this pavilion, our integrity.
And in little over two or three weeks, <unk> silk worms <unk> <unk> kilometers.
In a curious symmetry, this is the length of the silk route.
<unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 extra <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A <unk> silk through a robotic arm, the other full empty line.
If the last frontier of design is to give life to products and the buildings around us to form a two material ecology of two materials, the designers have to bring these two visions of the world.
Which brings us around, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of creation, which brings us from a design inspired by nature to an nature inspired nature in the design, which demands for us, for the first time, we take care of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you ever wondered what you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember what age they had when they asked them for the first time.
They can relate to your fingers.
Three. Five. Five. Five. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question is, "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I had no interest, but I had <unk>
In school I liked the English, the <unk> and the art and I took place websites -- also, by playing the guitar on a punk band called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard about us.
And in general, I like to test and persist anyway, because having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But with time this sense of <unk> this feeling of this is no longer a challenge, it gets to <unk>
And I have to let it go.
But then I'm going to get away by something else, totally different, and I would focus on it, and I'm going to get my <unk> and I feel <unk> I've found it <unk> and then again this point where I start <unk>
And finally, I want to give it back.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first was because I wasn't sure how it was going to turn all of this into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, deny all my other passions and <unk>
Another reason that caused me so much anxiety was a little more personal.
I worried that there was something wrong with this, and something wrong with me for not <unk> at all.
I was afraid to be afraid of engagement, or to be dispersed, or to be on my own success.
If you can relate to my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I'd like to give you back then.
<unk> themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I will tell you where the <unk> learned from culture.
Do you ask first, "What do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody matters what they were going to do to that age.
It's considered a naive question to make nice answers in children like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or "I want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
So this question gets us over and over again as we grow in different ways, they were going to be asked by high school students are asked to be asked in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It happens to be the cute exercise of before the dream.
Why?
If this question inspires kids to dream with what might be, it's not inspired to dream with everything they might be.
In fact, just the other thing, because when somebody asks you what you want to be, you can't respond to 20 different things, even though you're good <unk> maybe you will be <unk> and say, "Oh, how cute, but you can't be <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  And he is <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor turned into <unk> <unk> teacher and <unk>
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is they're going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real <unk> the idea that each one of us has something to go through during its time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing and dedicate your life to it.
But if you're someone who's not connected to this way?
What if there are a lot of different issues that take their curiosity and lots of different things that want to do?
There's no place for someone in that frame.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And I feel there's something wrong with one.
There's nothing wrong in you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with a lot of interest and creative activities.
It's a <unk> to say.
I could help if you divide into three parts: multiple potential and <unk>
You can also use other terms that you can use the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the age of the Renaissance, the ideal was the one who was good at multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as a <unk>
You know, any term you like or <unk> your own one.
It seems like a kind of <unk> to a community, we can't agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see the <unk> as limitation or <unk> that you should win.
But what I've learned about talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in this way.
Here's three superpowers ...
One: the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and the creation of something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their shared interests in cartography, visualization and mathematics and design and design, to <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates gold <unk>
<unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea for its <unk> mixture of skills and experiences.
Innovation happens at intersections.
Of course the new ideas.
And the <unk> with all their background can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower <unk> is learning fast.
When we <unk> them, we are interested in something, we're going to it.
We looked at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to being <unk> for having been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less fear of testing new things and get out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring all the things that we have learned to each new area that we rarely started from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> to complete and <unk>
As a child pianist was an amazing ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest known <unk>
Before it turned to the writer, he was financial <unk>
He had to learn the most fine sales mechanics when their practices, and this ability helps to write compelling moments for the editors.
It rarely has a loss of time to go to what you can do to you even if you end it at the end of it.
It's possible to apply that knowledge into a completely different field in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower, <unk> is adaptability. It is the ability to transform into anything that you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes the director of videos, others, <unk> <unk> sometimes a <unk> sometimes teacher, and sometimes, James <unk>
It's valuable because it does good work.
He's even more valuable because it can take different <unk> depending on the needs of your clients.
<unk> magazine defines adaptability as the most important skill for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so quickly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be able to meet the market needs the market needs that really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, quickly learning and <unk> three skills where <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that might lose if they're <unk> to reduce their targets.
As a society, we have a great interest in encouraging <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
<unk> from the belly knowing because they wanted to be <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you either.
In fact, some of the best teams come from a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The doctor can dive to deep and put in practice, and <unk> offers a amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that are going to deal with how we are connected.
And unfortunately, to the <unk> in a large part of them will be told to just be more like their fellow <unk>
I once said this, if there's one thing that you can take from this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with inner wiring -- whatever it is.
If you are a heart heart, then you go through all the media.
That's where you will give the best of yes.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes,  I say, <unk> with your many passions.
Keep the curiosity for those <unk> <unk>
Grab the intersections.
<unk> our inner wiring leads us to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, <unk> the world <unk>
Thank you.
In <unk> a woman named <unk> they took her to a psychiatric psychiatric model.
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of their life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her until she was unfortunately passed away from <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a <unk> and found strange <unk> and <unk> in the brain of a guy who had never seen before.
The even more surprising thing.
If I had been alive today, we could not give her more help than the <unk> gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient in receiving a diagnosis that we now call disease disease.
From <unk> medicine has advanced a lot.
They have discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect ourselves from <unk> many treatments for cancer, for HIV, for HIV, for <unk> and so much more.
But a little bit of progress on Alzheimer's disease.
I'm part of a team of scientists working to find a cure for Alzheimer's for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's is now affecting 40 million worldwide.
But by 2050, affect 150 million which, by the way, will include many of you.
If you expect to live until 85 years or more, the possibility of getting Alzheimer's will be almost one of each two.
In other words, there is the likelihood that you spend their years to go through Alzheimer's or helping take care of a friend or want to be wanted Alzheimer's.
Already in America, Alzheimer's disease costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of healthcare is spent in Alzheimer's disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease and its costs today -- a rise of five times by 2050, as the generation of the <unk> boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the greatest doctors and social challenges of our generation.
But it has been relatively little <unk>
Today, one of the top 10 causes of death around the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that can't be able to cure or even slow down their development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's other than the other diseases because we've spent less time and money in the research itself.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer research than Alzheimer's despite the fact that it costs us more Alzheimer's and causes a year number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what little people know, but the whole world <unk> Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last <unk> years, all of the scientists, including Alzheimer's scientists with aging.
We think it's going to be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But you just look at a picture of a healthy person in comparison with a Alzheimer's patient to see the actual physical harm caused by this disease.
In addition to trigger a severe memory and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's reduces significantly life expectancy and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and <unk> strangers in the brain of <unk> a century.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
Today we know that they're made from protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds up as an origami.
There are places in the role that are <unk>
And when it folds up well, these colored dots end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some points -- they stay on the outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form big plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are many steps, and the identification of what step block is complex, as a bomb.
You can do anything.
<unk> others can make the bomb <unk>
You have to find the right step that you need it, and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, in its most part, have reduced wires and expected the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> chemicals, physicists, engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've been able to identify a critical step in the process. Now you're testing a new kind of drugs that block specifically this step to stop the disease.
Let me show you some of our latest results.
No one outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's see some videos of what happened to test these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms -- and you can see that they move normally.
These maggots, on the other hand, they have some protein molecules that hit each other within them, like humans with Alzheimer's.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But when we give our new drugs to these worms in an early stage, then we see that <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just a good outcome but research as this sample that Alzheimer's disease is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of wait, there's real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to bring that hope, to overcome Alzheimer's, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We have to say that Alzheimer's disease is a disease and if we get it, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, the patients and their families have received more research and foreign pressure on governments, pharmaceutical industry and <unk>
That was essential to move forward to HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to overcome cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk to themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones and night, they're often too <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not in most cases a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> who can't create the change that they need for themselves.
<unk> talking about them, and help demand a cure.
Thank you.
I had this article in the neocortical column of the New York Times, in January of this year.
To fall in love with someone, I do this.
The paper is about a psychological study that was designed to create romantic love in the lab, and from my own experience to test it I was one night last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: two strangers will become <unk> to get through 36 questions, and then you both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions of example.
Number <unk> If you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or skill, which would be?
Number <unk> When was the last time you had another person?
And <unk>
We <unk> these are increasingly personal <unk>
Number four: <unk> really <unk> me to your partner what you like about him or her, I know very honest this time, and I gave things that you wouldn't say to anybody you've ever met.
When I came across this study a few years ago, a detail really called me attention to me, the gadget two of the participants had married six months later, invited all of the lab to the <unk>
So, it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, it was also <unk>
And when I had the opportunity to test this study, with someone who knew not particularly well, I didn't expect to know.
But I thought it was a good story, so I was going to send it to the column -- Love -- a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you probably are asking, are still going.
And the reason I think you challenge this is because I've done this question again and again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to it.
A week before the paper was published, I was very nervous.
I had been working on a romantic book over the last few years, so I had helped me write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog entry can get to a few hundred views like a lot, and those were usually just about my Facebook friends and imagined that my article in the New York Times would probably be a few thousand of the seen.
And that came up with a good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But as we did -- I had no idea.
The article was published on a Friday at night, and the Saturday, this happened on my blog.
And Sunday <unk> had already called the "Today Show and "Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the paper received more than eight million views, and I was, for saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster the confidence writing with openness, but something else is to discover that the loving life of one has been international news --  and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people called the paper, what they did every day for weeks, they always did the same question: still follow together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search for my email with the phrase: <unk> still <unk>
And several messages appeared right away.
They were of students and journalists and strangers like this.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
Even, I gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately got red.
I understand this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international diary. You should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I wasn't prepared for the <unk> of the answer.
36 questions seemed to have <unk> life life.
In fact, the New York Times published a <unk> article for San <unk> who included the experiences of readers when I test the study in them with different degrees of success.
So my first impulse to all this attention was to be really <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every petition that we both did a public emergence together.
I would pick up television interviews, and I would give the orders for us two.
I think I was afraid to become the icons of becoming the icons <unk> of the <unk> process, a range for which I didn't feel at the absolute <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know just if the study worked, they wanted to know if it really was able to do it, or if it was able to produce <unk> <unk> not just an adventure, but real love, love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel able to respond.
My relationship had just a few months and I felt about everything, that people made the wrong question.
How do you know if you're going to go together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was not, I would make the experience of doing these 36 questions less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there, the goal of the researcher was not producing romantic love.
Instead, I was looking for interpersonal students, between university students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study did work.
<unk> felt closer after doing that, several later studies were also used by <unk> protocol -- as a rapid way of creating trust and interaction between strangers.
They have been used by members of police and community members and community have been used by people in political <unk>
The original version of the story, which I tested last summer, which combines personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, was cited in this article, but unfortunately never published it.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk at a little university university, and then a student came up to me and told me with <unk> <unk> the study and didn't work.
He looked like <unk>
And I said, "You want to say that you love you from the person with the person who you will.
Well he did a pause.
I think she just wants us to be friends.
And I said, but they became better friends?
<unk> that I can get able to get better to do the research <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I came across the study for the first time when I was 29, I was going through a really difficult separation to me.
I had had that relationship since I had 20, what I was supposed to pretty much my adult life, and he was my first real love, and I had no idea how or I could live without him.
So I took to science.
And I did everything I could find about the science of romantic love, and I expected that that could sort of hold the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the time, I thought I just research for the book that I would write but in hindsight, it seems really <unk>
I thought if I was going to love with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad and I used to be able to feel like that.
And all of this knowledge has been useful in one way or another.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence to demand what I want.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably more than reasonably more than reasonably <unk>
What I'm looking for about love is an assurance -- not just being <unk> today and to be <unk> tomorrow, but to continue to be <unk> on the person I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee that people wondered when they wanted to know whether we were still together.
The story that the media was told about 36 questions is that there can be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way to somehow mitigate some of the risk of <unk> and this is a very scary story, because in love it makes us feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The story of the story that says, still follow together?
And his content with a answer of Yes or No.
So more than a question, <unk> that let's make questions more difficult, questions like, how do you decide who deserves your love and who isn't it?
How do you stay in in love when things go <unk> and how to know when to cut down and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship? Or even more, how do you live with doubt of your <unk>
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more intriguing conversation about what it means to love someone.
So, if you want the short version of the history of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a known year and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, we are still following together, and I'm very <unk>
But in love it's not the same as being <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my <unk> <unk> love didn't happen.
<unk> in love with a choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit about reading it now, not because it isn't true, but because in the moment, there was no idea what that choice was.
I didn't think how many times we would have both to take that decision, and how much times it will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he would always choose or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and responded by 36 questions, to have chosen to love someone as generous, and kind of fun and expressed that choice in the largest newspaper in the United States.
But what I've done, instead is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really do.
And what I <unk> and what I might spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy ending implicit in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the article that I didn't really wrote.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to love someone, and the hope that he also loved me, and it's scary -- but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a bunch of <unk> and in some way I got a <unk> of the forest.
The city of New York does a while.  Something that really affected me but more details later.
I'm going to start with when I was eight years old.
I took a box of wood, and I took a dollar ticket a pen bill and a knife in her somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought that some weird <unk> or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species would be, ideas, for example, how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
But anyway, it has a funny thing, because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At one point, I was in <unk> <unk> like to go from tour and make all those things <unk> and I was doing a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and I took all the pages and I made a kind of <unk> <unk> by Agnes Martin, the covered in resin and a bee was <unk>
Well, my mother has a fear of bees and he is <unk> and so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking he could <unk>
Instead, it happened to be the opposite: somehow it seemed to increase the size of size, as if it was <unk> text with a <unk>
So I did I <unk> I built more boxes.
And this time, I started to add electronic elements, frogs strange bottles that were finding out the street, all I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God can draw in space.
I can flow out <unk> just like it does about a body in the crime scene.
And I pulled out the objects and created my own taxonomy of specimens <unk>
First of all, you can make an idea.
And then I did some insects and weird creatures.
It was really fun to draw in the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was earning some money, to bring my girlfriend for dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was great man.
At some point I became interested in the human form, sculptures of natural size with drawings of human beings inside of layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I would tell me.
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I went to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass layers, similar to the drawing on a window, and then on another window and then on another window and it had all these windows together that make a three-dimensional composition of it.
And this really worked, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work would come with something very big -- that I call <unk>
To the <unk> inspired me in large measure in "The Orchard" of <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting in the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
Do you know it?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs <unk> pounds.
5.5 feet long.
It has <unk> face, so it's 10 feet long.
It's a little bit weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left is Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with animal heads travel between two worlds.
You'll go from the world of representation -- this <unk> of <unk> <unk>
Here is where creatures with animals are heading in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a bird god tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of Osama bin Laden, there are all kinds of weird things that can be found if they look very well in the ocean.
Anyway, also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in one hand, whereas the other hand is going out clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it looks like a <unk> that holds the Earth and the cosmos in equilibrium.
So it's a aspect of the <unk>
It's a little narrative.
That's the hand in which I <unk>
And then, when you go on the other hand, you have a <unk> like a bird's <unk> and spits out clouds of this <unk>
It also has a <unk> <unk> tail that joins the <unk>
Anyway, their tail turn on fire on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go up, you know.
Their tail ends up in a eyeball of <unk> <unk> letters of 1986.
You've got them <unk>
They were done in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards of terrorists.
Very <unk> at the time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is an archive of our culture, through media and material are <unk> dictionaries or magazines.
But each one acts as a kind of file in a form of being human, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at the time.
They're like cells, they come together, they come together.
And you can walk between them. It's getting years.
Each one is basically a microscope <unk> which weighs 1.3 pounds with a human being trapped inside.
This is a little cave on the chest.
That's the <unk> he's the chest, you can <unk> the entrance to it.
I'm going to see you for the rest of the body -- there is a waterfall and it's going to cover it from the <unk> or <unk> or whatever it does, a kind of thing <unk>
It's a quick overview of these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a body in half.
This has two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills coming out and enter the head of this strange statue out.
There's a little scene inside the cavity cavity inside it.
Can you imagine?
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box called <unk> <unk>
In this box there is a physical, a neuroscientist, a painter, a musician <unk> a musician, a musician, a writer, a publishing arm that spreads all the content we do in the world and a garden.
It takes the box and all the people inside it hits each other like particles.
And I think that's the way we change the world.
When you go to the one who is and the box that you're living in.
And together we got to realize that we are all together in this, that this illusion that we're different, these concepts of the countries, of the borders, of religion, doesn't work.
We're all very made of the same stuff and in the same box.
And if we don't start to exchange those things with sweet and <unk> and we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when your head?
They take a <unk>
But for this pill to have an effect against pain, first of the stomach, the guts and other organs.
So I'll take a pill is the most effective and <unk> system for any medication that is effect on the body.
The <unk> though, is that by <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in patients with HIV.
When you take <unk> drugs they use to reduce the amount of virus in the blood, and you will increase the bacterial cells.
But they are also known by their side effects <unk> in its very much negative, because in time that it takes to your sleep <unk> it will be <unk> and worse than the time it takes to get to its destination, which is where it's more important, which is where it's more important: in the warehouse of HIV.
These are regions of the body like the lymph <unk> the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't easily go into the bloodstream of the patients that are committed to regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the disruption of the treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new stem cells.
This is the big problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs that is a lifetime of life for life for oral lives.
One day, I sat down and I thought, "Could you get the treatment directly into the warehouse of the virus, without the risk of <unk>
As a scientist in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> for caring care and heart surgery -- they can be used for anything else, including transportation drug drugs.
In fact, we are using laser pulses to open up or <unk> extremely small, that open and closing holes -- almost immediately infected cells with HIV to introduce medicines.
The best people are saying, "How is that <unk>
So we sent a little solid beam laser on the cellular membrane with HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser travels through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of microseconds.
Before you even realize it, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro <unk> or <unk> plates, but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is: through a three heads.
With the first head, which is our laser, we're going to do a <unk> in the site of the infection.
The second head, which is a camera, is it going to the music site.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the drug, release it directly into the site of infection, as the laser is used again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to total HIV eradication in the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all research investigator in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studying armed groups, not armed organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
They were doing what these groups do when they're not <unk>
My goal is to understand better to these agents from violence from violence and study ways of encouraging violent participation to violent <unk>
I do field work in the world of politics and the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving all conflict in course, because war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between states and non-state actors.
For example, of the <unk> peace deals with 1975 and 2011, <unk> had been in between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> we should even be <unk> or <unk> in any process of working conflict process.
But how do you do that?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they ask it, how do they do, but no one analyzes what they do when they don't <unk>
The armed struggle and the <unk> policies.
Everything is part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
Public groups today are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known by his violent <unk> against Israel.
From their creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political party -- a social service network and military device.
Similarly, the Palestinian <unk> known for their suicide attacks against their suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the <unk> of Gaza from 2007.
So these groups make more than simply shooting.
It's multitasking here.
You know, a complex machinery of communication stations, radio channels and websites on the Internet and strategies in social networks.
And here you have the <unk> magazine in English and published to <unk>
<unk> groups also invest in a complex fundraising problem, but through business businesses, for example, construction companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to recruit better and build their brand.
The armed groups also do something else: they create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, they run hospitals, they put professional training programs or <unk>
<unk> offers all these services and more.
The armed groups are also trying to conquer the population by offering them something that is not safe and protection.
The rise of the Taliban had an Afghanistan torn for war or even the beginning of the rise of <unk> they can also understand the efforts of these groups to bring security together.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has an automatic while high for the population.
But in general, providing social services that means filling a vacuum <unk> a <unk> gap by the government, and allow these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the election victory of 2006 in 2006 cannot be understood without recognizing the social work of the group.
It's a really complex <unk> even in the West, when we look at the <unk> groups, we just think on the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, strategy or long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill up gaps by the government, and they emerge as armed and political groups, engage in the violent struggle and <unk>
And the more complex and the more sophisticated organizations, they are these organizations, we can actually behave as something opposite to a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
You know, part of a territory, run all of its <unk> they run the trash, and they run the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of nations of nations and <unk> and the more weak of them are the states, like in the Middle East the current and the current <unk> and they fill that gap the non-state actors.
This is important to governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in tools not military tools.
<unk> that government governance has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and put in the peace.
If we understand better to the <unk> groups, we'll understand better what incentives to promote the transition from violence to not violence.
In this new dispute between states and non-state actors, military power can win some battle, but we're not giving us peace and stability.
To achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill that safety void to fill that vacuum of the government that allowed these groups to thrive at a beginning.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman.
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid to accept <unk> <unk> would be unfair for <unk>
I'm <unk> but pretty bad bad.
And therefore I was struck by a bad feminist.
Or, at least I wrote a paper, and a book called "The <unk> and then in interviews, people started to call me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to myself and a <unk> <unk> has become a bigger thing.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was a young man, especially in my youth and the 20 years, I had weird ideas about <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with men and that we have to call sex as if that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women are treated around the world and anger, in particular, it looks like a perfectly reasonable response.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to the <unk> that might be a feminist.
It will be labeled a feminist was a <unk> a very taboo word.
I love as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which is asking too much, with high self-esteem and <unk> to believe that it's equal or <unk>
Nobody wants to be that <unk> woman until it realizes that it's actually that woman and you can't imagine somebody else.
Over time, as I was growing up, I started to accept that I am, in fact, <unk> and also proud to be.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
They would have the same good job.
We have right to travel around the world as we are free of harassing or violence.
We have right to use it in an easy way and accessible the contraceptives and services and services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, without needing for <unk> controls or doctrines to <unk>
We have the right to the respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you need to have our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and <unk> social condition and a lot more.
We need to have these differences and how we behave in the same way that matters what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our Feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear, I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession
When I lead to work, I listen to rap music -- all volume.
Although the letter degrades in women and offends me, the classic <unk> <unk> of yin yang <unk> is incredible.
He actually got your <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm totally <unk> by my musical thoughts.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> --  -- all the <unk> tasks -- but also killing insects, the <unk> <unk> and <unk> maintenance <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The rose is my favorite color.
<unk> of the fashion magazines and the nice things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of the fairy tales that they do.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt her last name of his husband, is her choice, and I'm not who for <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise their children, I accepted that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so it makes women economically vulnerable when they were <unk>
So let's take this problem.
<unk> the conventional Feminism that has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of women of color, and gay workers, gay workers, <unk> and <unk>
Listen, if that's good feminism is a very bad feminist feminist here.
It also happens by the following: You also have a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put sick, <unk> in a <unk>
We hope we hope that it will happen.
When we were <unk> the <unk> with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I consider to be <unk> from that <unk> before I try to put up there.
<unk> women, particularly innovative and the leaders of the sector, have fear of being tagged as a <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yeah, I'm a <unk> for fear of what that tag is <unk> for fear of not being able to fulfill a little realistic expectations.
Let's take <unk> or as I call it, <unk>
In the last few years it's a feminist <unk>
In <unk> Music <unk> in <unk> <unk> in front of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
It was a show of <unk> to see this pop star and embrace this star and to know women and young men who will be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> time, cultural critics started endless debates if <unk> was or not exactly a feminist.
<unk> his feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection of <unk> because we're still fighting for a lot, we want a lot, we need so much, so much.
We're far beyond the sensible criticism of <unk> and <unk> to <unk> the feminism of any woman, <unk> until there is nothing.
We don't need to do that.
The bad question or more good, a more inclusive feminism is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We went from recognizing our <unk> to give the word to the action and being a little <unk>
If I hear music music, I'm creating a demand for artists that would be more than providing a <unk>
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they improve changing affecting their profit.
It's certainly hard.
Why does your music be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when bad decisions make it justify that it makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, the equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my <unk> <unk>
It's two <unk> girls and <unk> and also very brave. I want you to grow in a world.
It will be told by the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best option will become much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is about the sex violence against women as sports, -- <unk> <unk> play.
We can change the radio rate when we hear songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to cinema in another part when movies don't treat women more than as dumb objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports sports where athletes treat their peers as <unk>
In any case, men, especially white men can say, "No, I'm not going to publish in his magazine, participate in his project, or working with you, until it doesn't include a number of women, so much to participate in the way to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or the organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but they are going to be involved in this kind of projects, we can also be able to be included even more as to more as being empowered to <unk>
We are no longer <unk> without these efforts, without taking these <unk> our achievements are going to mean very little.
We can make these little acts of bravery and expect our decisions to get to the top of the people in the power of the people in the ability and music and music and music, <unk> people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create a durable and significant change.
We can also claim with bravery our own, well, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist to not be in <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I say it about everything, because I <unk> my voice was <unk> and Feminism was helped me.
There was one incident.
I call it an incident to address what happened.
A few kids told me, when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They treated me as if it was nothing.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
<unk> my voice, and after all I didn't tell me to believe that I could say something that might matter.
But -- I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I became a stronger version of myself.
And I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and understand what meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of women who showed me that it was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write as myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and T-Mobile I also found that if it was a little brave, another woman could hear me and see that none of us is anything that the world is trying to tell us that we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other, I make the optimal reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad feminine <unk> I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope that we can all be a bit courageous, when you need a little bit of a <unk>
Just after Christmas last year, we had <unk> children in California had <unk> because I was exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, plus than 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things of this outbreak is that the <unk> which may be lousy for a child with an immune system is one of the most easily infectious diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for over a half century ago, but many of the kids involved in the outbreak were not vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something that was supposed to be still afraid of autism.
But a moment ago, it was not the article that unleashed the argument about autism and vaccines <unk> disqualified and marked by being a fraud <unk> by the British Medical Council.
It doesn't believe most intelligent scientists that the theory of vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents around the world continue to prevent their children in danger to their children of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the estimates of autism growing in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very strange disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard about her create all his professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the prevalence estimates continued stable just three or four children per 100,000.
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started to <unk>
<unk> of funds as <unk> <unk> refer to routinely autism as an epidemic as if I could make it from another child in <unk>
What's going on here?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people at the Center for Disease Control which is going on, tend to be based on phrases like <unk> diagnostic <unk> and a better detection detection to explain these <unk> numbers.
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother looking for the face of his son of two years, the visual contact.
If the diagnostic criteria had to figure out why they were so reduced to the beginning?
Why were autism cases so hard to find before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to figure out the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with slow progress and <unk> of science that we have the <unk> power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, doctors told a story about what autism is and how it discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had been lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us everything about how we get here and where we need to go.
The first story starts with a child psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital at Johns Hopkins Hospital in <unk> <unk> published an article that describes 11 young patients who looked like <unk> worlds <unk> people around her, even their own parents.
They could have been fun for hours by waving their faces, but they were <unk> of panic panic like when they don't put his favorite toy in his usual place without knowing it.
On the basis of the patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For the 1950s, as a major authority of the world on the subject, which had seen less than 150 true cases of its syndrome as we have references from places as far as South Africa.
This is actually no wonder, because the criteria for autism diagnosis were very <unk>
For example, I will give that diagnosis to children with seizures but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once he had turned to nine of every 10 kids sent for other doctors to his doctor's office by being <unk> without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of postpartum child or <unk>
These kids, he said, they've kept very carefully in a refrigerator that doesn't <unk>
At the same time, though, I noticed that some of his young patients had special skills that cluster together in certain areas like music, math and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before I turned two years old.
When his mother put one of his favorite records. He correctly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, claiming things like kids were just <unk> what they had heard their parents <unk> desperate to win their approval.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic kids were sent to institutions for their own good, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the decade of 1970, the researchers started to test the theory of <unk> that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> cognitive psychologist in London, thought that the theory of mothers <unk> <unk> was pretty stupid.
She and her husband John were warm and <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a child as a police service services, without special education, and no access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To stand for the National Health Service, they needed more resources for autistic children and their families, <unk> and their colleague, Judith Gould and their colleague, Judith Gould decided to do something that should be done 30 years before.
They launched a prevalence of autism prevalence in the general population.
I took a suburb from London called <unk> to try and find children's children in the community.
What they saw was clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse in it.
Some kids couldn't speak at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination with astrophysics, in the dinosaurs or in the <unk> of <unk>
In other ways, these kids didn't fit in nice paintings and <unk> as <unk> said, and they saw a lot of them, a lot more than the <unk> model would have predicted.
At first, they were lost by trying to make sense of their data.
How did no one had ever noticed from these kids before?
But then <unk> found a reference to an article published in German in <unk> the next year to the <unk> article and then <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> I knew about this article from competition, but he avoided <unk> <unk> in his own work.
There was no one translation in English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> was talking German, and he <unk> for her.
The paper offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran an integrated clinic with a school in Vienna, in Vienna, in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for children with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
And the morning in their clinic, they started with music exercises with music, and the kids were still on Sunday, Sunday afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, <unk> described as a <unk> disability by life that required <unk> and <unk> spaces over the course of all life.
Instead of treating kids in their clinic as patients, having the ones called them their little teachers, and he started to help in the development of education that were particularly suited to them.
Now, having seen autism as a continuum of diverse continuum that included an amazing variety of gifts, and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and always have been, seeing aspects of this continuum in <unk> <unk> as the awkward social scientist and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even to say, that for success in science and art, an ounce of autism is critical.
<unk> and Judith found out that <unk> was wrong that autism was <unk> so the parents were the <unk>
Over the next few years, worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of the diagnostic that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
In the end of the 1980s and early '90s, their changes in <unk> in <unk> by replacing the limited model of <unk> by a broad mixture of <unk>
These changes didn't fall in a broken bag.
<unk> when <unk> and Judith <unk> <unk> to reform these <unk> people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before <unk> <unk> I was just a small circle, <unk> by experts knew what autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> psychologists, psychologists, <unk> and parents around the world knew what the autism.
At the same time, they were introduced to the first easy clinical testing to diagnose autism.
I had no longer to have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for her son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network, a perfect storm of the awareness of autism.
The number of diagnostics started to <unk> just like <unk> and <unk> in fact they hoped that it was so expected that the people with autism and their families will finally support the support and the services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blaming the vaccines for the increase in the <unk> and a simple <unk> and <unk> credible story as bad as the <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the center of prevention that one in 68 children in the United States are in the spectrum, it's right, the <unk> are one of the world's largest groups in the world.
Over the past few years, people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that are the puzzles for solving by new advances -- doctors, <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think about terms of living operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows Windows -- doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to the <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and it suffers from a attention deficit <unk>
Indeed, people have a hard time to live in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> that believed that the <unk> for the most autism aspects of autism are found in understanding teachers, employers with capacity, of support, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
An autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover for <unk> the ship of the <unk>
As we move into an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society.
We can't afford to waste a brain.
Thank you.
